I went to the Portrait Gallery a little over a year ago and stood in front of this for a few minutes. This picture (and others, really) don't do the live piece any true justice. The remarkable detail and depth Kehinde Wiley applied to @barackobama Obama's portrait is masterful.l \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe. Most notably against the other presidential portraits is the set up: the framing, the lighting, the hall position, etc. simply stunning. Happy Presidents\u2019  Day in honor of this man who changed our understanding of race and politics in America.

He was commissioned in 2017 to paint a portrait of former President Barack Obama for the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery, which has portraits of all the US presidents. The Columbus Museum of Art, which hosted an exhibition of his work in 2007, describes his work as follows: \"Wiley has gained recent acclaim for his heroic portraits which address the image and status of young African-American men in contemporary culture.\" Most notable work is the Barack Obama Presidential Portrait. I had the honor of taking the photo no.2 of the President Obama Portrait @nationalportraitgallery in 2018.

            "text": "Our artist of the week is Kehinde Wiley! You have probably heard of him lately because he was the artist selected to paint Obama\u2019s presidential portrait (swipe to check it out). Kehinde\u2019s paintings are inspired by  Classical European paintings of noblemen, royalty and aristocrats but instead of white men he positions young black men and women \u201cwithin the field of power.\u201d His paintings are striking, and we encourage you to flip through the book we have at the studio. Come learn more about Kehinde Wiley at Open Studio on Friday! We will be open from 10am-5pm.\n.\n\nDid you know that 52 artists is made possible in part by a grant from @utahartsandmuseums ? We are so grateful for their support!\n.\n#openstudio #kehindewiley #52artists #artist #blackartist #art #artlesson",

I was visiting @thegreatsurprisal in Seattle when I ran across his painting. If I knew then what I know now, that that trip would be formative to who I am and what I\u2019ve become. Vibrant hues and gilded frames, Wiley evokes images that calls to the nobility in you. Your soul stirs and dna pulses and you feel every bit the royal we shout out 24/7 on SM to be #QUEEN \ud83d\udc78\ud83c\udffe\n.\n.\nAnd so when I, Oluwafunmilayo Awoyomi, first generation Nigerian American, beholded the second Kehinde Wiley here in 2020, I am...grateful.

That\u2019s why he was the first doggie (don\u2019t tell him, it\u2019ll kill him) to visit the museum. And they were super cool about it. Great job Mera and Don Rubell.

From day one he saw ME!\nHe has been a true #KnightInShiningArmor that I have learnt so much from and had the privilege to see new parts of the world with, from London to see the #KINGofPop \ud83e\udd34\ud83c\udffe exhibition to Dakar, #BlackRockSenegal the #MotherLand and back. \nThe first photo is a major #fbf to exactly 1yr ago at the opening of @thearmoryshow and the official unveiling of my portrait.\nThe armor I am wearing here was not what was initially planned. But as fate would have it, the significance of it was unbeknownst to Kehinde or myself at the time, but Kehinde ended up choosing this one instead and I ended up with a regal #Lion \ud83e\udd81 on my chest plate. \nNot only am I a #Leo, but my father is a #Sutton and the #familycrest is a Lion !

            "text": "The Quarter \nMaybe the problem is that I got involved with the wrong crowd of gods when I was seven. At first they weren't harmful and only showed themselves as fish, birds, especially herons and loons, turtles, a bobcat and a small bear, but not deer and rabbits who only offered themselves as food. And maybe I spent too much time inside the water of lakes and rivers. Underwater seemed like the safest church I could go to. And sleeping outside that young might have seeped too much dark into my brain and bones. It was not for me to ever recover. The other day I found a quarter in the driveway I lost at the Mecosta County Fair in 1947 and missed out on five rides including the Ferris wheel and the Tilt-A-Whirl. I sat in anger for hours in the bull barn mourning my lost quarter on which the entire tragic history of earth is written. I looked up into the holes of the bulls' massive noses and at the brass rings puncturing their noses which allowed them to be led. It would have been an easier life if I had allowed a ring in my nose, but so many years later I still find the spore of the gods here and there but never in the vicinity of quarters. \nJim Harrison\n\nIn Search of Small Gods \nCopper Canyon Press #poetrycommunity #poetryofinstagram #poetrylovers #poetryporn #poetryislife #poems#presidentsday #presidents #jimharrison #coins #gods #kehindewiley #wiley",

If it wasn\u2019t for the certain people who took me under their wings and showed me the game I\u2019d still be stuck in South London thinking that working at Wimpy or Kings On The Rye was my only option. \nShouts to @kim_art_ee for bringing Sasha down and being my guest last night and the ever amazing @myvanwys for the blessing. I appreciate you. \nIf you live in London and love art this is a must see. Portraits of everyday people from the streets of Dalston by an artist perhaps best known for his portrait of Obama. Go investigate , it\u2019s a goodie. \n#rundem #rundemcrew #kehindewiley #williammorrisgallery",

A beautiful, and very meaningful, work of art!\ud83d\uddbc\u2728\"Painting is about the world we live in. Black people live in the world. My choice is to include them. This is my way of saying yes to us.\" - K.W.\u2728Wiley was born in 1977, in Los Angeles, California. His mother is African-American, and his father is from Nigeria. His mother always supported his art, enrolling him in several after school programs. At the age of 12 he studied art briefly in Russia. He was educated at the San Francisco Art Institute, where he received his BFA, in 1999. In 2001, he received his MFA from Yale. He is known for his sometimes controversial art of painting African-American men and women in classical scenes. Wiley utilizes many Old Master's references, easily fusing them with French Rococo, lush foliage, and Islamic, and West African textiles. Turning them into beautiful, large, highly detailed portraitures. He also creates stunning stained glass portraits. Much of the public had their first introduction to the artist when In 2017, then President Barack Obama chose the artist to paint his official presidential portrait, to be permanently displayed in the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery. It was the first time a black artist had been chosen. The portrait was unveiled in February 2018, to mixed reviews. The foliage in the painting includes symbolism important to subject; Chrysanthemums, from Chicago, Jasmine from Hawaii, and African Blue Lilies.\u2728I've been fortunate enough to view Wiley in person, and was blown away by the size and details of the paintings.

The painting depicts Obama sitting in a chair seemingly floating among foliage. The foliage is described by the author as \"chrysanthemums (the official flower of Chicago), jasmine (symbolic of Hawaii where the president spent most of his childhood) and African blue lilies (alluding to the president's late Kenyan father).\" Reacting to the unveiling of his portrait Obama said: \"How about that? That's pretty sharp\". The Washington Post described the painting as \"not what you'd expect and that's why it's great\".\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nTogether with Amy Sherald's portrait of Michelle Obama, the paintings were unveiled at the National Portrait Gallery on February 12, 2018. Both portraits mark the first time two African-American artists were commissioned by the National Portrait Gallery.\u201d\u2063\n\u2063\n#paintings #painting #artlovers #artists #famousart #artlegends #art #thearts #everythingart #arteverything #artislife #artislife\ud83c\udfa8 #dailyart #fineart #artoftheday #artstagram #artofinstagram #arthistorian #arthistorynerd #arthistory #historyofart #artlove #kehindewiley #wiley #presidentbarackobama #smithsonianportraitgallery #barackobama #blackartists #contemporaryart",

This major painting is an extension of the artist\u2019s Rumors of War series, which takes the form of historic equestrian portraiture. In Wiley\u2019s hands, this established genre expands in scale to over nine feet in each dimension, and explodes in color with a revelry of bold and bright hues. Opposed to tradition is also the fact that the sitters for these works are not the typical European nobleman in a powerful position but people the artist meets on the street, mostly from New York. #KehindeWiley #equestrianportrait #PrinceTommaso #parkprojects #RumorsofWar #santabarbaramuseumofart\nImage: Kehinde Wiley, \u201cEquestrian Portrait of Prince Tommaso of Savoy-Carignan,\u201d 2015.

            "text": "Kehinde Wiley\nLA-born, New York-based artist Kehinde Wiley is known for his glorious portraits of black subjects on decorative floral backgrounds, which have often looked to British arts and crafts pioneer William Morris for visual inspiration. In 2018 he became the first black artist to paint an official US presidential portrait, selected by and depicting Barack Obama for the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery (alongside Amy Sherald who depicted Michelle); while his previous subjects included Notorious BIG, Grandmaster Flash and Ice T. Now, his artistic focus has turned to the women of Dalston, east London, for a show of new works to be displayed at William Morris Gallery, in nearby Walthamstow \u2013 the artist\u2019s first solo exhibition at a public institution in the UK. The location for the show hints at Wiley\u2019s long-term fascination with William Morris and his floral motifs, which he has sourced for his paintings for over 15 years. The Yellow Wallpaper is Wiley\u2019s first series to focus on exclusively female subjects and is a visual response to a well-known feminist text of the same name by American novelist Charlotte Perkins Gilman. Published in 1892, the short story tells the semi-autobiographical tale of a woman diagnosed with hysteria, living in one room and forbidden from working as a form of treatment. In turn, it explores the consequences of denying women independence. In response, each of Wiley\u2019s portraits depicts his subjects as autonomous and empowered. \u2018Kehinde Wiley: The Yellow Wallpaper\u2019 opens at \u2018William Morris Gallery\u2019 from February 22, \u2013 May 25, 2020.\n#neonurchin #neonurchinblog #dedicatedtothethingswelove #suzyurchin #ollyurchin #art #music #photography #fashion #film #words #pictures #neon #urchin #theyellowwallpaper #charlotteperkinsgilman #painting #dalston #blackwomen #williammorris #williammorrisgallery #kehindewiley",

            "text": "A highlight of my Richmond trip a few weeks ago was seeing Kehinde Wiley\u2019s sculpture, The Rumors of War, in front of the @vmfamuseum. I had seen a retrospective of Wiley\u2019s paintings in Phoenix a few years ago and loved his work. Having driven past the numerous Confederate statues on Monument Avenue for years as a kid, I couldn\u2019t wait to see this piece and how it would help bring this street into the 21st century.\n~\nModeled after a statue of Confederate General J.E.B. Stuart, the nearly 30-foot tall statue is so impressive; I just wish I\u2019d had blue skies for my backdrop. In addition to offering you the chance to see Wiley\u2019s largest 3-dimensional work, the VMFA is a fantastic museum with an incredible art nouveau collection. It\u2019s a must-see when you\u2019re in Richmond! And if you\u2019re going to London soon, there are some new Wiley paintings on display through May 25 at the William Morris Gallery. \ud83d\uddbc \ud83d\udc4d\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#richmond #virginia #art #sculpture #vmfa #kehindewiley #rva #artmuseum #artmuseums #history #artphotography #travel #travelphotography #tripadvisor #roadtrippin #wanderlust #blackexcellence",

            "text": "Next summer, the portraits will hit the road to reach an even wider audience. \nIn Washington, D.C., dozens of people line up behind velvet ropes every day to admire artist #KehindeWiley's interpretation of the former president. It features Obama sitting at the edge of a wooden chair, surrounded by lush foliage. Pink and white flowers are dispersed across the canvas. \"I think that it demonstrates the one drop of color that we've had in our 45 presidents, which is significant in its own way,\" says Michael R. Jackson, \nThe portrait #AmySherald painted of Michelle Obama is displayed behind its own ropes. The former first lady poses against a pastel blue background, wearing a geometric dress of pink, yellow, black and white.\n\nKim Sajet, director of the National Portrait Gallery  credits Wiley and Sherald's artistic vision for much of the popularity of the pictures, which are a departure from some of the more conventional presidential portraits of the past.\n\nSajet says she began receiving calls from curators at other museums shortly after the unveiling, asking for an opportunity to host the artworks temporarily. Now five cities have been selected for the yearlong tour that kicks off in June of next year: Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, Atlanta and Houston.",

            "text": "The Quarter \nMaybe the problem is that I got involved with the wrong crowd of gods when I was seven. At first they weren't harmful and only showed themselves as fish, birds, especially herons and loons, turtles, a bobcat and a small bear, but not deer and rabbits who only offered themselves as food. And maybe I spent too much time inside the water of lakes and rivers. Underwater seemed like the safest church I could go to. And sleeping outside that young might have seeped too much dark into my brain and bones. It was not for me to ever recover. The other day I found a quarter in the driveway I lost at the Mecosta County Fair in 1947 and missed out on five rides including the Ferris wheel and the Tilt-A-Whirl. I sat in anger for hours in the bull barn mourning my lost quarter on which the entire tragic history of earth is written. I looked up into the holes of the bulls' massive noses and at the brass rings puncturing their noses which allowed them to be led. It would have been an easier life if I had allowed a ring in my nose, but so many years later I still find the spore of the gods here and there but never in the vicinity of quarters. \nJim Harrison\n\nIn Search of Small Gods \nCopper Canyon Press #poetrycommunity #poetryofinstagram #poetrylovers #poetryporn #poetryislife #poems#presidentsday #presidents #jimharrison #coins #gods#kehindewiley #wiley",

            "text": "Crystal Bridges and its newest contemporary art space, The Momentary, #sponsored my trip out to Bentonville last weekend. I enjoyed the art, the food, met some peers in the industry, but the conversations with locals reminded me this wasn\u2019t my typical art trip. We were in Arkansas and I realized how much I had taken for granted museums in big cities.\n\u2014\nArts education is already hard to come by. My art history class in high school was cut right as I graduated - and that\u2019s with growing up in one of America\u2019s top public school systems outside of DC, where I already had access to tens of free national museums. Out in Bentonville, without these two art spaces, there was virtually nothing. Now, however, murals dot the entire town, paintings have popped up in yoga studios, an art hotel sits in the historical center. I\u2019m always interested in how art can reach more people - and I\u2019m particularly eager to see how the story of art will continue to shape in this community. Without a doubt, bringing Rothkos and Kusamas here will have far greater impacts on a region than bringing yet another to NY or LA where it might just sit in storage.\n\u2014\n#YayoiKusama #PatSteir #DoHoSuh #KehindeWiley #MarkRothko #AliceNeel #DaleChihuly #JosephCornell #CrystalBridges #TheMomentary #LiveInTheMomentary",

            "text": "The Quarter \nMaybe the problem is that I got involved with the wrong crowd of gods when I was seven. At first they weren't harmful and only showed themselves as fish, birds, especially herons and loons, turtles, a bobcat and a small bear, but not deer and rabbits who only offered themselves as food. And maybe I spent too much time inside the water of lakes and rivers. Underwater seemed like the safest church I could go to. And sleeping outside that young might have seeped too much dark into my brain and bones. It was not for me to ever recover. The other day I found a quarter in the driveway I lost at the Mecosta County Fair in 1947 and missed out on five rides including the Ferris wheel and the Tilt-A-Whirl. I sat in anger for hours in the bull barn mourning my lost quarter on which the entire tragic history of earth is written. I looked up into the holes of the bulls' massive noses and at the brass rings puncturing their noses which allowed them to be led. It would have been an easier life if I had allowed a ring in my nose, but so many years later I still find the spore of the gods here and there but never in the vicinity of quarters. \nJim Harrison\n\nIn Search of Small Gods \nCopper Canyon Press #poetrycommunity #poetryofinstagram #poetrylovers #poetryporn #poetryislife #poems#presidentsday #presidents #jimharrison #coins #gods #kehindewiley #wiley",

            "text": "The Quarter \nMaybe the problem is that I got involved with the wrong crowd of gods when I was seven. At first they weren't harmful and only showed themselves as fish, birds, especially herons and loons, turtles, a bobcat and a small bear, but not deer and rabbits who only offered themselves as food. And maybe I spent too much time inside the water of lakes and rivers. Underwater seemed like the safest church I could go to. And sleeping outside that young might have seeped too much dark into my brain and bones. It was not for me to ever recover. The other day I found a quarter in the driveway I lost at the Mecosta County Fair in 1947 and missed out on five rides including the Ferris wheel and the Tilt-A-Whirl. I sat in anger for hours in the bull barn mourning my lost quarter on which the entire tragic history of earth is written. I looked up into the holes of the bulls' massive noses and at the brass rings puncturing their noses which allowed them to be led. It would have been an easier life if I had allowed a ring in my nose, but so many years later I still find the spore of the gods here and there but never in the vicinity of quarters. \nJim Harrison\n\nIn Search of Small Gods \nCopper Canyon Press #poetrycommunity #poetryofinstagram #poetrylovers #poetryporn #poetryislife #poems#presidentsday #presidents #jimharrison #coins #gods #kehindewiley #wiley",

I gave it \u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50\u2b50 as it's the perfect alignment of gallery, artist and subject. These empowered women are on display until 25 May, it's free to visit and an ideal exhibition to see during the upcoming International Women's Day weekend.\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n.\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n.\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n.\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n#KehindeWiley #WilliamMorrisGallery #Walthamstow #EastLondonArt #TabsTopArt #InternationalWomensDay #IWD2020 #ContemporaryPortrait #Portrait #FloralPortrait #Art #OriginalArt #ContemporaryArt #Gallery #LondonArt #Artwork #ArtOfInsta #ArtOfInstagram #Exhibition #LondonGallery #LondonArtCritic #ThePeoplesArtCritic #ArtCritic #ArtOfTheDay #Artist #ArtistsOnInstagram #Beautiful #InstaArtist #NewArt #LondonArtScene",

            "text": "The Quarter \nMaybe the problem is that I got involved with the wrong crowd of gods when I was seven. At first they weren't harmful and only showed themselves as fish, birds, especially herons and loons, turtles, a bobcat and a small bear, but not deer and rabbits who only offered themselves as food. And maybe I spent too much time inside the water of lakes and rivers. Underwater seemed like the safest church I could go to. And sleeping outside that young might have seeped too much dark into my brain and bones. It was not for me to ever recover. The other day I found a quarter in the driveway I lost at the Mecosta County Fair in 1947 and missed out on five rides including the Ferris wheel and the Tilt-A-Whirl. I sat in anger for hours in the bull barn mourning my lost quarter on which the entire tragic history of earth is written. I looked up into the holes of the bulls' massive noses and at the brass rings puncturing their noses which allowed them to be led. It would have been an easier life if I had allowed a ring in my nose, but so many years later I still find the spore of the gods here and there but never in the vicinity of quarters. \nJim Harrison\n\nIn Search of Small Gods \nCopper Canyon Press #poetrycommunity #poetryofinstagram #poetrylovers #poetryporn #poetryislife #poems#presidentsday #presidents #jimharrison #coins #gods#kehindewiley #wiley",

Set against highly decorative backgrounds recalling William Morris\u2019s floral wallpaper, and saturated with the colours of west African ankara (prints), Wiley self-consciously depicts his subjects in the formal traditions of European high art. The point, Wiley suggests, is to bring together these different traditions as a way of thinking about the historical exclusion of certain kinds of bodies from the privileges of high art. The paintings are incredible, urgent and extremely powerful. Running til 24 May 2020. #art #identity #portraiture #painting #kehindewiley #williammorris #williammorrisgallery",

            "text": "New exhibition alert!!!\n.\n.\nKehinde Wiley: The Yellow Wallpaper \nAt the William Morris Gallery\n22 February \u2013 25 May 2020\n\nThis will be the first solo exhibition of new work shown by Wiley at a public institution in the UK and also the first to feature exclusively female portraits. The works offer a visual response to \nAmerican novelist Charlotte Perkins Gilman\u2019s acclaimed feminist text- The Yellow Wallpaper (1892).\n.\n.\n'The Yellow Wallpaper is a work of literary fiction that explores the contours of femininity and insanity. This exhibition seeks to use the language of the decorative to reconcile blackness, gender, and a beautiful and terrible past.\u2019 - Kehinde Wiley @kehindewiley\n.\n.\nWiley\u2019s new portraits feature women that he met on the streets of Dalston, East London, each positioned as autonomous, as powerful, as open to individual interpretation and as an emblem of strength within a society of complicated social networks. They wholly embody myriad positions with regard to social class, status, religion, colonialism and the negotiation of gender.\n\nAt the core of Wiley's practice is an analysis of the intersecting points between cultural and aesthetic values and existing historical narratives. In this charged moment, these discourses reveal how relations of power produce, sustain, and reinforce particular interpretations of transcultural exchanges and subject positions.\n\nIn 2018 Wiley became the first African-American artist to paint an official U.S. Presidential \nportrait for the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery. Former U.S. President Barack Obama \nselected him for this honor. His works are included in the collections of numerous public \ninstitutions around the world.\n\nExtremely excited to be attending the private viewing of this tomorrow! Huge thank you to @weareparable \ud83d\udda4\u2728\n.\n.\n. \n@morrisgallery\n#kehindewiley #yellowpaper #art #artlife #artist #blackartist #blackart365 #dopeblackart #williammorris #intersectionality #blackness #gender #insanity #elevate #inspire #identity  #blackexperience #heritage #culture #blackhistory  #colonialism #africanamerican #freeart #londonexhibition",

            "text": "The Quarter \nMaybe the problem is that I got involved with the wrong crowd of gods when I was seven. At first they weren't harmful and only showed themselves as fish, birds, especially herons and loons, turtles, a bobcat and a small bear, but not deer and rabbits who only offered themselves as food. And maybe I spent too much time inside the water of lakes and rivers. Underwater seemed like the safest church I could go to. And sleeping outside that young might have seeped too much dark into my brain and bones. It was not for me to ever recover. The other day I found a quarter in the driveway I lost at the Mecosta County Fair in 1947 and missed out on five rides including the Ferris wheel and the Tilt-A-Whirl. I sat in anger for hours in the bull barn mourning my lost quarter on which the entire tragic history of earth is written. I looked up into the holes of the bulls' massive noses and at the brass rings puncturing their noses which allowed them to be led. It would have been an easier life if I had allowed a ring in my nose, but so many years later I still find the spore of the gods here and there but never in the vicinity of quarters. \nJim Harrison\n\nIn Search of Small Gods \nCopper Canyon Press #poetrycommunity #poetryofinstagram #poetrylovers #poetryporn #poetryislife #poems#presidentsday #presidents #jimharrison #coins #gods #kehindewiley #wiley",

            "text": "My love of art is right next to my love of interiors so to be in a room surrounded by the art of @kehindewiley and to meet the main man himself was just overwhelming. \nThe importance of representation of black women in art if fundamental and sorely lacking. But to see this in my manor in little old Walthamstow was phenomenal. All these women were approached in Dalston, East London and asked if Kehinde could paint their portraits. \nThe exhibition is on until May at @williammorrisgalleryyounkins and it is well worth a trip.\n\nI was also in the company of other great artists and creatives and wonderful people including @mjfontaine,  @wildsuga, @simonfrederick, @dreph_ , @daddydarkrdc, @mellymellove, @knowyourcaribbean, @teanne83 . Brilliant in their own rights and I am so proud of their achievements and influence and generally loveliness.\n\nDefinitely a great Friday night .

            "text": "I have very few items on my to-see list this trip. Last time I spent a day and a half seeing almost every monument on the Mall, going to 4 museums, and walking 12 miles in one day to do so. But one of the things I missed was the National Portrait Gallery. I love Kehinde Wiley, so I\u2019ve been wanting to see President Obama\u2019s portrait in person since it was unveiled. It was beautiful!\n.\nI also thought Michelle Obama\u2019s portrait was much better in person. There\u2019s a lot of detail in color that creates more movement, which is difficult to capture on camera.\n.\nThere happened to be a John Singer Sargent charcoal exhibit that Justin went full fangirl on. It was really cool! Standing back, many of them look 3D and seem to have full connecting lines or details that your eye fills in, but then up close, they\u2019re much less clear. You realize something you thought was a fully drawn necklace is just a couple of squiggles and highlights. The 7th slide is William Butler Yeats looking all dreamboaty. From afar his eyes seem so distinct. Up close, they seem like just shadow. It\u2019s wild!\n.\nMan, give me an afternoon with a bunch of art and I am basically in heaven. Revisiting the National Gallery of Art is definitely on my list this time. I missed the Piet Mondrian last time I went and that must be rectified! \ud83d\ude0a",

            "text": "Now that is a brilliant portrait. First, there are the bright colours of the background. They seem like a radical break with tradition as most presidential portraits are set in darker surroundings between mahogany furniture. But the bright colours bring the president forward whereas darker ones would have have hidden him. The plants are not just a backdrop, they grow around him and I have been told that they each have a meaning significant to Barack Obama. There are flowers associated with Chicago, Hawaii, Indonesia and Kenya. Each of these places has a special importance in his life. They are not just behind him. They grow around him and their colours reflect off his suit as if to say that they are a part of him. But all of that might be mistaken for mere cleverness, if it wasn\u2019t for his actual portrait. Just look at the pose. He is not sitting back in his chair, like a monarch on a throne. No he is leaning forward in an active pose. It makes him engage with the audience, as if he is actively listening to us. The fact that he doesn\u2019t wear a tie makes him less formal and even more approachable. And then there is the face. He looks at us with an earnest expression, but if you look closely there seems to be a tiny hint of a smile in the corner of his mouth. Truly a masterpiece that I would love to see up close some time. In the meantime there is an exhibition of Kehinde Wiley\u2019s work a little bit closer to me. He has a show in the William Morris Gallery in London until May 25th. It may well be worth it to check if there are shows of his near you at some point because his work is really interesting. \nPresident Barack Obama, Kehinde Wiley, 2018, National Portrait Gallery, Washington DC. .\n#obama #portraits #kehindewiley #nationalportraitgallery",

            "text": "As we celebrate Black History Month, Buddha Jones is excited to introduce the #BuddhaInspirationSeries where we will be celebrating inspiring creatives who make a difference in the arts. We begin with Kehinde Wiley (@kehindewiley) whose style of portraiture also serves as the inspiration for our series. Kehinde is a Nigerian-American portrait painter based in New York City who is known for his highly naturalistic paintings of black people. After serving as artist-in-residence at the Studio Museum in Harlem, Kehinde began selling out solo exhibitions while having his art collected in museums across the country. Perhaps most notably, in 2017 Kehinde was commissioned to paint the portrait of former President @barackobama for the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery. Thank you, Kehinde for your incredible contribution to the arts with your unique and colorful perspective. \ud83c\udfa8 by Buddhan Amma Fordjour.",

            "text": "Even though I only spent 10 hrs in Londen, I still managed to get a train to Walthamstow to visit this spectacular Kehinde Wiley exhibit at the William @MorrisGallery museum. The combination is incredibly fun, because I mainly knew William Morris for his decorative and flowery wallpaper designs. Kehinde Wiley was invited to make new work (I could still smell the paint) based on a feminist short story from 1892: 'The Yellow Wallpaper' by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. In this semi-autobiographical story, Gilman speaks about being locked in her bedroom after being diagnosed with hysteria (which is not a thing, rather Victorian code for: a nonconforming woman..). The horrid yellow wallpaper in her room, combined with a lack of freedom, agency and independence drove her to despair. American artist Kehinde Wiley, perhaps most famous for his portraits of the Obamas, is known for making incredibly powerful pieces in vivid colours. He\u2019s an accomplished painter who contrasts modern elements of hiphop culture and black people (who have often been marginalised in history) with classical art historical elements and classic frames that you\u2019d associate with classic paintings. He\u2019s empowering the people he portrays and that\u2019s exactly what he did here. He invited a variety of women he met on the streets of Dalston in East London into his studio and photographed them. Subsequently, he immortalised them in paint in combination with the yellow wallpaper that seems to hurt your eyes, while simultaneously reconciling blackness, social class, status, colonialism and gender. He connects those to the past. I was unable to effectively capture how spectacular this exhibit was in a photo, but I tried: swipe to see more photos. \nPS Morris was arguably the most important designer (and utopian thinker) of 19th century England, the founder of the fantasy genre and incredibly important for both the socialist movement and the arts and crafts movement (that placed renewed value on traditional craftsmanship in a time of technological advancement).",

            "text": "I highly recommend the \"Jacques-Louis David Meets Kehinde Wiley\" exhibit at Brooklyn Museum. Pairs Kehinde Wiley's 'Napoleon Leading the Army over the Alps' (2005) with the painting that inspired it, Jacques-Louis David\u2019s 'Bonaparte Crossing the Alps' (1800\u20131). Bonus points because they have the Rumors of War statue that was in Times Square earlier this year that I wanted to look at more, and they have some other cool stuff there too. When you go, make sure to look all around - I thought it only had those two paintings, but there's more in the front and the back. #BrooklynMuseum #davidxwiley #KehindeWiley #blackart",

            "text": "Rumors of War by Kehinde Wiley\n\"In these toxic times art can help us transform and give us a sense of purpose. This story begins with my seeing the Confederate monuments. What does it feel like if you are black and walking beneath this? We come from a beautiful, fractured situation. Let's take these fractured pieces and put them back together.\" - Kehinde Wiley.\nKehinde Wiley (born 1977) is an American artist known for repositioning black youth within the classical European tradition of power and status. With Rumors of War, he expands this concept while directly engaging the national conversation around monuments and their role in perpetuating incomplete histories and inequality. As a direct response to the Confederate statues that line Monument Avenue in Richmond, Wiley conceived the idea for Rumors of War when he visited the city in 2016. Rumors of War takes its inspiration from the statue of Confederate Army General James Ewell Brown Stuart created by Frederick Moynihan in 1907. As with the original sculpture, the rider strikes a heroic pose while sitting upon a muscular horse. However, in Wiley's sculpture, the figure is a young African American dressed in streetwear. Proudly mounted on it's large stone pedestal, the bronze sculpture commemorates African American youth lost to the social and political battles being waged throughout our nation. \n#kehindewiley #sculpture #art #favoriteartist #monument #rva",

            "text": "Kehinde Wiley\n\u201cWe would show them examples of my paintings and I would just plead my case. For some it was an immediate yes, and for others it was a decided no. But I think what you\u2019ll see is a kind of cross-section of the community.\u201d - Kehinde Wiley, Artist and William Morris enthusiast. \u2018The Yellow Wallpaper\u2019 is an exhibition of new portraits by American artist Kehinde Wiley. This will be the first solo exhibition of new work shown by Wiley at a public institution in the UK and also the first to feature exclusively female portraits. None of the sitters in this new body of work are well known. Wiley recruited them one afternoon, in Dalston, east London, where he and a team of assistants spent an afternoon scouting, \u201cmostly in marketplaces\u201d. They were drawn to these women by their dress, attitude, looks, carriage or charisma. The works offer a visual response to American novelist Charlotte Perkins Gilman\u2019s acclaimed feminist text \u2018The Yellow Wallpaper\u2019 (1892). Wiley\u2019s striking subjects are depicted in his trademark maximalist style. \u2018Kehinde Wiley: The Yellow Wallpaper\u2019 opens at \u2018William Morris Gallery\u2019 from February 22, \u2013 May 25, 2020.\n#neonurchin #neonurchinblog #dedicatedtothethingswelove #suzyurchin #ollyurchin #art #music #photography #fashion #film #words #pictures #neon #urchin #theyellowwallpaper #charlotteperkinsgilman #painting #dalston #blackwomen #williammorris #williammorrisgallery #kehindewiley",

He creates vibrant and political portrayals of black folk, ranging from teens he meets on the streets, to fellow artists, and even the great former President Obama. He often appropriates, or re-uses recognizable art history images and tropes in order to critique art historical norms and to use pre-existing tools to elevate black folk to the important positions inhabited by the predominantly white faces of art history.\" What do you think?

Mr. Wiley takes many of the colors, styles and poses traditionally reserved for White subjects and makes a space for Black subjects to exist in the same realm #blackhistorymonth #blackartists #kehindewiley",

These portraits capture the power, royalty and fierceness of black women in an insane world. He illuminates each woman against a vibrant, ornate background, depicting them in royal poses of the past. I love the way Wiley's work pulls from history and rejects it at once. This exhibition is simply stunning. Friends in London, definitely make the trip to see it.",

Before that, much of the great talent and effort that was applied to painting was principally relegated to religious iconography.  In the 18th and 19th centuries, people could finally have access to an artist. Artists began to service the wealthy classes. The democratization of portrait painting is something that we see specifically in Western Europe around that period of time. Concentrating now on society portraits is an economic argument. Originally, only the wealthy could afford to have portraits painted, so by virtue of that, the only ways that we see the underclass in a lot of historical portraiture is in folk images that look at the underclass at an arms length, as sort of charming subjects that were usually commissioned by the wealthy as colloquial scenes.\u201d\u2063\n\u2063\n\"The series of work attempts to reconcile the presence of black female stereotypes that surrounds their presence and/or absence within the context of art history and notions of feminine beauty therein. I am questioning contemporary ideals of beauty and power and celebrating the presence of black women, creating a rightful place for them within art history which has been an almost exclusively white domain.\"\u201d\u2063\n\u2063\n#modernart #20thcenturyart #paintings #painting #artlovers #artists #famousart #artlegends #art #thearts #everythingart #arteverything #artislife #artislife\ud83c\udfa8 #dailyart #fineart #artoftheday #artstagram #artofinstagram #arthistorian #arthistorynerd #arthistory #historyofart #artlove #kehindewiley #wiley #marylittlelaterladycarr #blackart #blackhistorymonth",

Charlotte Perkins Gilman's 1892 short story The Yellow Wallpaper, is incredibly relevant today - it's no wonder Wiley is inspired by the sinister depiction of a woman  we would now consider as  gaslighted by her husband.\nhttps://www.wmgallery.org.uk/whats-on/exhibitions-43/kehinde-wiley/\n.\n #periodwallpaper #yellowwallpaper\n#williammorris #wallpaperhistsoc #welovewallpaper #kehindewiley #picturesatanexhibition #artgallery",

            "text": "#factfriday: Did you know that since 2008, just 2.3% of all acquisitions and 7.7% of all exhibitions at the 30 most prominent US museums have been work by African-American artists? And that a single museum, the @studiomuseum in Harlem, NY accounts for a full 2.7% of that figure? \u2022\nIn 2017, a painting by #jeanmichelbasquiat sold for $110.5m at Sotheby\u2019s, becoming the most expensive work by an American artist ever sold at auction. But just 25 years before that, a proposed tour of his work curated by the @whitneymuseum was cancelled because no museums came forward to host it. \u2022\nGreat strives are being made in creating more opportunities to promote and give audience to a more diverse body of artists. It is all of our responsibility to support these exhibits, shows, tours, and other efforts that offer a broader, more inclusive look at art and history. \u2022\nLocal opportunities include the @levinemuseum, the @hbganttcenter, the @themintmuseum, and the @mccollcenter \u2022\nStories of African-American artists don\u2019t just represent the faces of the narrative but play a vital and beautiful role in portraying our shared humanity. \u2764\ufe0f \u2022\nSources: @sothebys @hyperallergic @artnet @artsy @ncbis \n#representationmatters #blackhistorymonth #blackhistory #celebrateblackhistory #blackartists #whyartmatters #americanart #contemporaryart #contemporaryfigurativeart #americanartists #sharedexperiences #aseatatthetable #celebratediversity #amysherald #kehindewiley #kerryjamesmarshall #highschoolart #artteachersofig #plpart #clt #cltart #cltartscene #charlottesgotalot #charlotteartscene",

This is my way of saying yes to us.\u201d - Kehinde Wiley\n.\n.\nTitle | Napoleon Leading the Army Over the Alps by Kehinde Wiley, 2005 Oil on canvas .\n.\nThis portrait imitates the posture of the figure of Napoleon Bonaparte in Jacques-Louis David's painting Bonaparte Crossing the Alps at Grand-Saint-Bernard. The artist thereby confronts and critiques historical traditions that do not acknowledge Black cultural experience. Wiley presents a new brand of portraiture that redefines and affirms Black identity and simultaneously questions the history of Western painting.- BM\n.\n.\nBlack History is a 360 cypher.

The figure is a young African American man with locs in a ponytail, jeans ripped at the knee and Nike high-top sneakers. Proudly mounted on its large stone pedestal, the bronze equestrian sculpture commemorates African American youth lost to the social and political battles being waged throughout our nation.

            "text": "What makes a #portrait a #masterpiece? Great #painter? Important sitter? Certainly. Male painter? Male sitter? Very, very likely. White painter? White sitter? Almost inevitably. #lgbtq brother #kehindewiley (b. 1977) asks these questions by re-imagining some of #arthistory\u2019s most celebrated #works. This is his \u201cNapoleon Leading the Army over the Alps\u201d from 2005 and which belongs to the #brooklynmuseum. #equestrianportraits are terribly laddish affairs with the muscular prowess of the horse employed to translate the testosterone-fuelled ego of its rider, swinging into the #artist\u2019s composition as if he\u2019s hung like the horse he straddles. They\u2019re about #power and propagandist self-aggrandizement. #wiley\u2019s painting is a remix of #jacqueslouisdavid\u2019s work from 1800-1 which depicts the megalomaniacal midget #napoleonbonaparte. Little #napoleon is now a #blackman, resplendent in #camouflage fatigues, cloaked in a gold cape and wearing Timberland boots, sweatbands and a bandana. This dude hails from the #street, not some fucking palace. Whilst anonymous, he is, indeed, a real person since Wiley\u2019s practice is to make #portraits of strangers he meets (and who he subsequently photographs in classical poses) as source material. This unknown black guy now assumes the position of authority David reserved for a white Emperor. That seismic shift of Signification buckles the ground from under our horse and rider, in turn interrogating indices of power usually reserved for white men of privilege. The ground is etched with the names of those men - \u2018Hannibal\u2019 or \u2018Bonaparte\u2019 - but also of black #slaves who were all given generic white names such as \u2018Williams\u2019. It\u2019s here, in this #structuralist chasm, that one finds the real truth of Wiley\u2019s design. A black contemporary hero tramples on white (#art and political) history\u2019s pattern of idolisation and victimisation. And all across the painting, barely visible even in person, are microscopic #sperms, wriggling in and out of this totem to #toxicmasculinity, lubricating the realness of this powerful shift of white, straight control into black, #queer power. #mcwqueer #art",

What better way to celebrate Black History Month than learning about a powerful and talented artist like Kehinde and the importance of representation for all in history, culture, and throughout our daily lives. The Art Center strives to provide exhibit and programming throughout our community that help create an educational and safe environment for all voices to be heard and artwork to be seen. Thank you to this wonderfully, talented community and the supportive partners within it.

It is a very important question, especially at this moment in our culture. \u2014 @kehindewiley\n.\nThough now Kehinde Wiley sometimes paints well\u2013known figures, he still practices the collaborative method he developed in his early career, which he calls \u201cstreet casting.\u201d As he did with this early painting, Wiley chooses as his portrait subjects ordinary young African American men (and increasingly, women) that he sees passing by on the street. If the chosen model agrees to a portrait, Wiley has him leaf through art history books and choose a pose from the images. Wiley then paints his usually street-clothes-clad model in a pose derived from Baroque portraits of monarchs or Renaissance paintings of saints. With this method, he presents a contemporary person of color within the grandiose traditions of Old Master paintings, where historically black men and women were absent or relegated to the margins.\n.\nKehinde Wiley (American, born 1977), Saint Francis of Paola.

            "text": "Black Lives Matter at School Week of Action starts today! #rhhsart2 i loved having the opportunity to share the work of Kehinde Wiley with you today. Wiley uses traditional visual vocabulary of wealth, power, and prestige, but applied to traditionally underrepresented persons. his recent statue Rumors of War is a direct response to the Confederate statues of Richmond\u2019s Monument Avenue, which he began thinking about when he visited Richmond for the opening of his show A New Republic at the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. (i saw that show! it is absolutely amazing to experience Wiley\u2019s work in person- from the vastness of Morpheus (see my photo of people standing in front of it) to the surprising intimacy of the Iconic series when presented in a smaller darker space.) from the VMFA: \u201cWiley\u2019s career has focused on addressing and remedying the absence of black and brown men and women in our visual, historical, and cultural narratives.\u201d you can follow Wiley here @kehindewiley and the VMFA here @vmfamuseum #kehindewiley #anewrepublic #rumorsofwar #blacklivesmatter #blacklivesmatteratschool\n#chooseyourownartventure",

Wiley is an American contemporary artist known for his highly naturalistic portrait paintings of black people and known for painting President Obama\u2019s national portrait in 2017! Also an incredible artist to spotlight during #BlackHistoryMonth, throughout his artistic career Wiley has worked to incoporate black narratives and subjects into the art historical canon and to challenge preconceptions of black masculinity as synonymous to violence through his vibrant portraits of young black people. #KehindeWiley #BlackHistoryMonth",

            "text": "Kehinde Wiley is a young, African-American painter who is quite literally changing the face(s) of portraiture with his sensitive, vibrant, and political portrayals of black folk, ranging from teenagers he meets on the streets, to fellow contemporary artists, and even former President Barack Obama.\n\nWiley made a name for himself for his naturalistic, brightly colored portraits of young black men, often with dramatic flowery backgrounds. With black masculinity often framed as synonymous with fear and violence in the USA, his generous and vibrant portraits challenge viewers' preconceptions of their subjects and bring young men, and people, of color into the galleries and museums they are so woefully underrepresented in.\n\nWiley often references\u00a0Old Masters\u00a0paintings for the pose of a figure. Wiley's paintings often blur the boundaries between traditional and contemporary modes of representation. Rendering his figures in a realistic mode\u2014while making references to specific\u00a0Old Master\u00a0paintings\u2014Wiley creates a fusion of period styles and influences, ranging from French\u00a0Rococo, Islamic architecture, and West African textile design, to urban\u00a0hip hop\u00a0and the \"Sea Foam Green\" of a\u00a0Martha Stewart\u00a0Interiors color swatch. Wiley depicts his slightly larger than life-size figures in a heroic manner, giving them poses that connote power and spiritual awakening. Wiley's portrayal of masculinity is filtered through these poses of power and spirituality.\n\nWiley's work falls into the category of\u00a0Identity Politics, which is art, film, and writing, which deals primarily with aspects of the artist's identity, for example race, gender, and sexuality. It is vitally important to Wiley that black people, especially black American men, are both the subjects and the audience of his paintings. At a time when young black men are constantly vilified in the press and mainstream media, and even murdered on the street by racist policemen, Wiley's portraits are an essential document of the power, fashion, versatility and beauty of the black community in the USA.\n\n#blackhistorymonth ##bhm2020 #blackartists #kehindewiley #blackart",

            "text": "3 WISEMEN \u2022 #TrulyInspired when I recently planned a conference for my job in Philly at #PAFA. I visited the space in January and saw the gallery, museum, and amazing working spaces of the students...immediately I was sold on renting this for our event. .\n.\nFast forward to the night of our welcome reception, I was gliding through each gallery in the museum when I saw @kehindewiley\u2019s masterpiece. Now, this piece wasn\u2019t visible when I visited in January, but the other night i saw it glowing in the center of the museum. And I couldn\u2019t be more proud to have chosen this venue. With my solo exhibit around the corner, I was truly inspired to get back in the studio and work!!\n.\n.\nAmong other things, my trip to Philly was very rewarding. See y\u2019all on 3/28! <link for tickets in bio>\n.\n.\n.\n#kehindewiley #tatianacamice #loveart #love #artistsoninstagram #supportblackart #blackart365 #oilpainting #skartspace #nyc #nyart #brooklyn #blavity #betair #essencemag",

            "text": "Kick off Women\u2019s History Month with a trip on the Victoria line.  Take it to the last stop: Walthamstow Central and walk 12 minutes north to an impressive house on the edge of Lloyd Park, the former home-turned-museum of textile designer William Morris.  An exhibit of portraits by Kehinde Wiley (on view there until 25 May) at first seems out of place. Then you realize just how intentional the venue was. \"The Yellow Wallpaper\" in one of firsts:  it is the first solo exhibition of Wiley in the UK, and the first to feature exclusively female portraits.  The works feature women the artist met on the streets of Dalston and serve as a visual response to American novelist Charlotte Perkins Gilman\u2019s semi-autobiographical feminist text, The Yellow Wallpaper (1892). The text portrays its narrator locked in her bedroom after being diagnosed with hysteria and driven mad by the yellow wallpaper in the room to which she is confined.  The story explores the disastrous consequences of denying women independence. In Wiley\u2019s new portraits, each woman is positioned as independent, as powerful, and as an emblem of strength within a society of complicated social networks. For over fifteen years Wiley has sourced William Morris\u2019s iconic floral designs for his paintings.  In these works, his subjects are depicted in reimagined fields inspired by the textiles of William Morris.  The details of the wallpaper jump from background to the foreground, challenging the strength of the women and their own sanity.  By juxtaposing the determined, independent black woman of today against British decorative history, the viewer is forced to consider their cultural context and their blackness.  Definitely worth the hike to E17. .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#kehindewiley #williammorris #yellowwallpaper #charlotteperkinsgilman #walthamstow #artinlondon #freeart #williammorrisgallery #textiles #decorativearts #colours #colourful #portraiture #women #femininity #feminine #internationalwomensday #womenshistorymonth #power #floral #wallpaper #female #futureisfemale #oiloncanvas #arthistory #artknowledge #collectart #portraits #wetaketheworkoutofworksofart #equality",

            "text": "Kehinde Wiley, the artist behind Barack Obama's wonderfully leafy portrait, uses his paintings to tackle issues around race, sociopolitical power, and the limited scope of art history. He describes what he does as \u201cintervention\u201d, saying that he \u201cquotes historical sources and positions young black men within the field of power.\u201d \u2060\n\u2060\nThat's why he often paints people of color into classic equestrian portraits, a tendency which may explain what inspired photographer Martin Schoeller to do the same in this fantastic portrait of the artist in his studio.\u2060\n\u2060\n\u201cIf black lives matter, they deserve to be in paintings,\u201d Wiley once said, and the people seem to agree. Since Wiley hit the art world, he has become one of the wealthiest living artists and is arguably the most successful black artist since Basquiat. People love Wiley, but not just for his paintings. He has a bombastic personality and a killer sense of style to say the least. He has been known to rock zebra print suits from time to time.\u2060\n\u2060\nPhoto for GQ magazine by Martin Schoeller.\u2060\n\u2060\n\u2060\n#kehindewiley #artistportrait #representationmatters #blackhistorymonth #blackartists #arthistory #historyofart #arthistory101 #oilpainting #equestrianportrait #horse #martinschoeller #GQ #GQmagazine #artlovers #artsed #artseducation #artmatters #americanart #artnerd #arthistorian #artiststudio #atelier #artistatwork",

Thiogo Oliveira do Rosario Rozendo, from the World Stage: Brazil series, (2009), Kehinde Wiley - Wiley\u2019s subjects were young men from their favelas (Portuguese for \u201cslum\u201d).

Africa Restored (Cheryl As Cleopatra), (2003), Kerry James Marshall - Reversing art historical narratives of modernist\u2019s paintings appropriation of African sculpture, it offers a complex meditation on African ancestry & black aesthetics.\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\n6.) You\u2019re Obviously in the Wrong Place, (2016), Virgil Abloh - This installation questions the lack of young black designers in high fashion.\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\n7.)

            "text": "Another fantastic exhibition up at the Brooklyn Museum. Jacques-Louis David Meets Kehinde Wiley explores the contrast between two epic works and the ever looming cultural contexts in which they were produced.  While personally I felt that the exhibit was going for grandiosity but that it felt wrong in the context of the works (they do that on their own), I really enjoyed the exhibit. It was really an exceptional experience to see such iconic pieces in person, and to finally find out why @kehindewiley uses sperm in his work (hypermasculinity and it\u2019s connection to aggression, and in turn the military)! #brooklynmuseum #exhibition #kehindewiley #napoleon #art",

            "text": "If this reminds you of something, it should. It\u2019s by Kehinde Wiley done in 2006. His interpretation of Saint John the Baptist, entitled St. John the Baptist, II is part of the permanent collection at the Nasher Museum of Art at Duke University. If you scroll through you\u2019ll see why it reminds you of something. Wiley was chosen as the official portrait artist for President Barack Obama whose stunning portrait hangs in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, DC. I took these pictures this week and then back in August 2018. \nAccording to the Smithsonian Kehinde Wiley is \u201cknown for his vibrant, large-scale paintings of African Americans posing as famous figures from the history of Western art.\u201d That\u2019s certainly the case with the first painting which is based off the original St. John the Baptist also on display at the Nasher. But with Obama, Wiley took a different approach seeing as how the President was already an important historical figure. For this portrait Wiley incorporates his trademark floral motif background to pay tribute to Obama\u2019s background: \u201cThe chrysanthemums, for example, reference the official flower of Chicago.

Wiley's work takes traditional portraits, people, and notions of British colonization and turns them into symbols of Jamaican pride!\n\n#SayItLoud #KehindeWiley\nCome find Wiley's work on display as a part of 'Say It Loud,' on display until May 16!",

            "text": "Kehinde Wiley\n\u201cHe\u2019s not so well known in the US, but my mom was what you might call a junk dealer. [Her store] wasn\u2019t really an antique store, but it sold second-hand furniture, oftentimes from old estates. So as a kid, I grew up seeing a lot of floral patterns, some Morris-inspired, some actual Morris pieces, among the stuff she was selling. And from very early in my life, there was this ornate sensibility inscribed.\u201d - Kehinde Wiley, Artist and William Morris enthusiast. Kehinde Wiley, the man who painted Barack Obama, turns his attention to women he met in Dalston. The American artist, known for his portraits of black men and women on botanical backgrounds has long been inspired by the maximalist florals of William Morris and, in something of a coup for the institution, his latest collection are being displayed at the Walthamstow gallery dedicated to the Victorian maverick. Wiley's show takes its name from Charlotte Perkins Gilman's 'The Yellow Wallpaper' a now-classic novel about a young woman confined to one room after being diagnosed as an hysteric. The story's main theme of denying women freedom informs Wiley's images of powerful, modern black women and the complex world they live in. \u2018Kehinde Wiley: The Yellow Wallpaper\u2019 opens at \u2018William Morris Gallery\u2019 from February 22, \u2013 May 25, 2020.\n#neonurchin #neonurchinblog #dedicatedtothethingswelove #suzyurchin #ollyurchin #art #music #photography #fashion #film #words #pictures #neon #urchin #theyellowwallpaper #charlotteperkinsgilman #painting #dalston #blackwomen #williammorris #williammorrisgallery #kehindewiley",

A talent who was commissioned to paint former President Barack Obama\u2019s presidential portrait. Now hung in the Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery (which holds a portrait of all US presidents). All of us lived through history, seeing Obama take office as the first African-American president & Kehinde Wylie, with the power of art, became the first African-American artist to paint an official presidential portrait. His work can be seen in galleries across the states; check out his Instagram to see other familiar faces he has painted.",

Also to @chermosa for curating #thedinnerparty and bringing it into my real life. \nFun fact, when I saw the dinner party I was more than a little emotional and overwhelmed for quite a few reasons before I even walked in.  And then I walked in, and I started to weep cause of all that and many other things (being in the presence of the work of so many women, finally seeing a piece i\u2019d been hearing about since I was a wee women\u2019s studies major, etc.) and then I looked over and there was this white dude fucking explaining (mansplaining) the dinner party to the girl he was with!  I laughed out loud, the tears sucked back into their tear ducts, I regained my composure and went about my art enjoying.\n1) #jeffreygibson 2&3) #judychicago 4) #simoneleigh with #njidekaakunyilicrosby in background 5) #peponosorio 6) #kehindewiley 7) #elainereichek 8 & 9) #lizalou 10) #marisol",

            "text": "These days, when I read articles about @kehindewiley, they often describe him as the artist who painted Obama's portrait. Which is true he is. But to me he's so much more than that. He's the artist who's elevated portraying everyday black people to an art form that can be exhibited in galleries and museums. That's what I appreciate the most about his art. If you're not familiar with his work and you're in London , go check out The Yellow Wallpaper exhibition at the William Morris art gallery in Walthamstow which features portraits of Black women from Dalston. It's a bit out of the way but it's FREE! The exhibition is on until May so you have plenty of time to plan a trip \ud83d\ude0a\n#colourful #art #blackart  #portrait #portraitart #artforthepeople #artforeveryone #blackwomen #blackgirls #blackbeauty #blackgirlmagic #representation #representationmatters #contemporaryart #modernart #blackpopculture #fortheculture #KehindeWiley #London #freeLondon",

            "text": "CXA ON VIEW: \u2018The Yellow Wallpaper\u2019 by Kehinde Wiley, at the William Morris Gallery.\n\nThe Yellow Wallpaper\u2019 is the first solo exhibition of new work shown by Wiley at a UK museum as well as the first to feature exclusively female portraits. The exhibit features women that the artist met on the streets of Dalston and offers a visual response to American novelist Charlotte Perkins Gilman\u2019s acclaimed feminist text, The Yellow Wallpaper (1892). In Wiley\u2019s new portraits, each woman is positioned as autonomous, as powerful, as open to individual interpretation and as an emblem of strength within a society of complicated social networks. They wholly embody myriad positions with regard to social class, status, religion, colonialism and the negotiation of gender.\n\nFor over fifteen years Wiley has sourced William Morris\u2019s iconic floral designs for his paintings. Building on his interest in the relationship between the human body and the decorative, Wiley\u2019s models are depicted in reimagined fields inspired by the William Morris oeuvre. Wiley\u2019s portraits offer a rubric through which to engage with the beautiful yet fraught histories and traditions that black women \u2014 and all women \u2014 are heir to.\n\nFeatured Images: \u2018The Yellow Wallpaper\u2019 at the William Morris Gallery, UK.\n\n@kehindewiley\n@charlotteperkinsgilman\n@morrisgallery\n@stephenfriedmangallery\n\u2014\u2014\n#kehindewiley #williammorris\n#charlotteperkinsgilman #dalston\n#williammorrisgallery #theyellowwallpaper\n#feministart #stephenfriedmangallery",

            "text": "Today's CRAFT CRUSH CORNER is dedicated to @kehindewiley , whose show 'Yellow Wallpaper', about British suburbia, women, mental anguish and colonialism we just saw at @morrisgallery . .\n\nIt was a bold move to put a show about coming to terms with the 'terrible histories and traditions we're heir to' as typified by fussy English floral wallpaper at the WILLIAM MORRIS GALLEY, HOME of fussy English floral wallpaper. It was also a move we rlly admired, on the part of both artist and gallery. Ain't nothing like a bit of self-awareness. .\n\nThe pieces are all large, lavish oil paintings, and are all of black women the artist met on the street in Dalston and asked to pose for him. The attention to detail led to many a fond rush of love and recognition (the patent leather shoes, the Supreme t- shirt, the Reebok trainers!). The wallpaper patterns growing over the women was such a cool visual for English social mores creeping over and restricting newcomers as well. .\n\nOverall we were rlly moved by this exhibition and left feeling v. validated in our own mission to use traditional crafts to represent modern life.

In honor of Black History Month, I will be creating multiple digital and motion graphic paintings throughout the month celebrating African American philanthropists, artists, directors, designers, etc \ud83d\udc90\ud83d\udc90 \u2022 The series begins with Kehinde Wiley (@kehindewiley), one of my favorite artists. Kehinde is a Nigerian-American portrait painter based in New York City, who is known for his highly naturalistic paintings of black people. After earning his BFA from the San Francisco Art Institute in 1999 and his MFA from Yale University School of Art in 2001, he became an artist-in-residence at the Studio Museum in Harlem. He then began selling out multiple solo exhibitions while having his art collected in museums across the US \ud83c\udfa8 \u2022 My piece was inspired by Kehinde's art style. More specifically, this piece was inspired by Wiley's portrait of Barack Obama, which was unveiled to the public in February 2018. This piece was created in Kehinde's art studio in China.\n\ncreated using Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe After Effects\n\n#blackartist #blackhistorymonth #bhm #motiongraphics #kehindewiley",

However, there\u2019s something to be mined and gained by looking at them in a new way. What happens when you see black bodies that have not previously been celebrated on the walls of the most important institutions in the world? What happens when you see them dance across the screen of a canvas? They start to read differently. It becomes a question of \u201cHow do we code the body?\u201d Not only in current time, but how does that current time reflect everything that we know historically, art historically and socio-historically?

So inspired and proud of my students\u2019 thoughtfulness, creativity, and perseverance. 11x17 prints. #kehindewiley #symbolism #digitalart #middleschoolart #middleschoolartteacher #art #googledrawing #quiltpattern #wallpaper #patterns",

            "text": "CXA ON VIEW: \u2018The Yellow Wallpaper\u2019 by Kehinde Wiley, at the William Morris Gallery.\n\nThe Yellow Wallpaper\u2019 is the first solo exhibition of new work shown by Wiley at a UK museum as well as the first to feature exclusively female portraits. The exhibit features women that the artist met on the streets of Dalston and offers a visual response to American novelist Charlotte Perkins Gilman\u2019s acclaimed feminist text, The Yellow Wallpaper (1892). In Wiley\u2019s new portraits, each woman is positioned as autonomous, as powerful, as open to individual interpretation and as an emblem of strength within a society of complicated social networks. They wholly embody myriad positions with regard to social class, status, religion, colonialism and the negotiation of gender.\n\nFor over fifteen years Wiley has sourced William Morris\u2019s iconic floral designs for his paintings. Building on his interest in the relationship between the human body and the decorative, Wiley\u2019s models are depicted in reimagined fields inspired by the William Morris oeuvre. Wiley\u2019s portraits offer a rubric through which to engage with the beautiful yet fraught histories and traditions that black women \u2014 and all women \u2014 are heir to.\n\nFeatured Images: \u2018The Yellow Wallpaper\u2019 at the William Morris Gallery, UK.\n\n@kehindewiley\n@charlotteperkinsgilman\n@morrisgallery\n@stephenfriedmangallery\n\u2014\u2014\n#kehindewiley #williammorris\n#charlotteperkinsgilman #dalston\n#williammorrisgallery #theyellowwallpaper\n#feministart #stephenfriedmangallery",

            "text": "If you use a piece of tracing paper and place it over a reference image, you can identify the shapes of the figure you are trying to draw. Imagine you are going to X-Ray the figure in order to find the key shapes underneath. This will allow you to create an outline that you will use to redraw and recreate the figure on a new piece of paper. This is a helpful exercise to practice figure drawing.

Painted in a style of relaxed elegance and ease, the portrait attributes a noble status to the subject through artistic tropes used to convey glory, wealth, and prestige.

            "text": "Day 19/29: If you\u2019ve ever watched Empire or the Blackish episode titled \u201cO Mother Where Art Thou?\u201d, you\u2019ve seen Kehinde Wiley\u2019s work (@kehindewiley). Well, you\u2019ve actually seen his work on tv in a major way as he was the FIRST black artist (along with Amy Sherald) to be commissioned to paint the first black president in 2018. Crazy how long it took, right? \ud83d\ude14 Wiley is known for painting pictures of African American men in classic, heroic poses. Most dressed in regular street clothes, Wiley\u2019s subjects are observed then chosen randomly, invited to his studio then asked to assume poses of Renaissance masters that communicate pride and power. Read below why he chooses this perspective in his work (interview on theartstory.com): \ud83d\udc47\ud83c\udffd\n\u201c[My approach is] interrogating the notion of the master painter, at once critical and complicit... [my] paintings quote historical sources and position young black men within that field of power... Art is about communicating power, and it's been that way for hundreds of years. Artists have been very good at working for the church and for the state, communicating the aspirations of society. What I choose to do is take people who happen to look like me, black and brown, people all over the world increasingly, and allowing them to occupy that field of power... When I have exhibitions, the people who don't belong to the typical museum demographic show up. People view themselves within the rubric of possibility.\"\n\ud83c\udfa8 \ud83d\udd8c\ud83c\udfa8\n#kehindewiley\n#blackartontv\n#africanamericanartists\n#blackartists\n#blackhistorymonth2020 \n#bhm2020 \n#bhm2020withesther\n#2aiming4arrows \n#lifewithesther",

Us & Them, (1991), Gary Simmons - This installation portrays a unity & familiarity despite our differences.\u2063\n\u2063\n2.) 150 Portrait Tone, (2017), Mark Bradford - This painting has woven in it the harrowing words spoken by Diamond Reynolds, Philando Castille\u2019s girlfriend, after she realized he had been fatally shot.\u2063\n\u2063\n3.) The Sound of Silence, (1978), Charles White - Inspired by the Simon & Garfunkel song lyrics, the theme advocated for the need of love in an era of discord.\u2063\n\u2063\n4.) Nightlife, (1943), Archibald J. Motley Jr. - This painting displays the vibrancy of a dance hall in the Bronzeville neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago in the 40\u2019s. It also depicts a keen understanding of the social interactions between men & women.\u2063\n\u2063\n5.) Untitled, (1992), Glen Ligon - These etchings contain excerpts from writings by Zora Neale Thurston (\u201cHow It Feels to Be Colored Me\u201d) & Ralph Ellison (\u201cInvisible Man\u201d). \u2063\n\u2063\n6.) Awards Room at the Johnson Publishing Company Headquarters, Chicago, Illinois,\u2063 (2011), David Hartt - This photograph captures the futuristic & luxurious interior of the Johnson Publishing Company Headquarters, the publisher of Ebony & Jet magazines.\u2063\n\u2063\n7.) Imagine (Trayvon Martin), (2013), Adrian Piper - \u201cImagine what it was like to be me.\u201d This work continues Piper\u2019s career long look into the limits of empathy.",

I bet you were all \u201cHow she gonna talk about black contemporary artists and not mention Kehinde?\u201d Ha! Like I could ever forget- he\u2019s a rockstar. \nFrom the deliberate representation of people of color in his works to the significance of their pose and the symbolism of the environment around them- to the scale (his pieces can be massive) his work is so rich, so full of presence it\u2019s easy to see why he is so beloved. My students always feel connected with his work. It\u2019s emotional. You don\u2019t know him- get to know him. .\n.\n\nBy applying the visual vocabulary and conventions of glorification, history, wealth and prestige to the subject matter drawn from the urban fabric, the subjects and stylistic references for his paintings are juxtaposed inversions of each other, forcing ambiguity and provocative perplexity to pervade his imagery.\n\nWiley\u2019s larger than life figures disturb and interrupt tropes of portrait painting, often blurring the boundaries between traditional and contemporary modes of representation and the critical portrayal of masculinity and physicality as it pertains to the view of black and brown young men.\nInitially, Wiley\u2019s portraits were based on photographs taken of young men found on the streets of Harlem. As his practice grew, his eye led him toward an international view, including models found in urban landscapes throughout the world \u2013 such as Mumbai, Senegal, Dakar and Rio de Janeiro, among others \u2013 accumulating to a vast body of work called, \u201cThe World Stage.\u201d- kehindewiley.com\n.\n.\n#kehindewiley #contemporaryart #contemporarypainting #blackhistorymonth #blackartist #portraiture #obama #knowyourartist",

Featuring six new large-scale female portraits, the exhibition offers a visual response to American novelist Charlotte Perkins Gilman's acclaimed feminist text, 'The Yellow Wallpaper', 1892. \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n@kehindewiley explains, \"\u2018The Yellow Wallpaper' is a work of literary fiction that explores the contours of femininity and insanity. This exhibition seeks to use the language of the decorative to reconcile blackness, gender, and a beautiful and terrible past.\"\n________\nGilman's text is a semi-autobiographical tale which sees her narrator confined to her bedroom after being diagnosed with hysteria and explores the disastrous consequences of denying women independence. These new portraits feature women that the artist met on the streets of Dalston, East London. Viewed from below in three-quarter view, the figures gaze directly at the viewer from a lavishly patterned background. Wiley employs the heroic visual vocabulary of traditional portraiture to position the subjects as autonomous, powerful and emblems of strength within a society of complicated social networks. Recalling a style once used almost exclusively to depict white aristocratic subjects, these portraits distil a complex dialogue about race and identity in a post-colonial age. 'The Yellow Wallpaper' runs through Monday 25 May.\n________\nKehinde Wiley, \u2018Portrait of Asia-Imani, Gabriella-Esnae, and Kaya Palmer\u2019, 2020.

In 2005, VH1 commissioned Wiley to paint portraits of the honorees for that year\u2019s Hip Hop Honors program.

This show is in response to the Charlotte Perkins Gilman tale of the same name by a woman driven to the brink of insanity by the \u2018rest cure\u2019 prescribed after childbirth trapped in a room with  tortuous yellow wallpaper. He says The yellow Wallpaper has \u2018haunted him for years and the the idea of being in a room and not being taken seriously\u2019 .\nIn the book she writes \u2018I never saw a worse pattern in my life the colour was repellent revolting with a sickly sulphur tint\u2019 \nKehinde Wiley captures Dalston women recreating powerful  poses from classical paintings of noblemen, royalty and aristocrats and the contemporary figures are  interweaved in floral designs sourced over fifteen years from William Morris\u2019s designs. The results are bright, contemporary,  powerful and there\u2019s no escaping their gaze not surprised Barak Obama chose him to paint his portrait. \n#kehindewiley #theyellowwallpaper #dalston #walthamstow #losangeles #lomdonart #williammorris #wallpaper #portraitpainter #figurativepainting #comtemporaryart #classicalpaintinginspiration #airforceone #branding #art #barakobamaportrait #charlotteperkinsgilman #feministliterature",

In the early 2000s, Wiley quickly became known for replacing subjects in historical paintings with the figures of Black men, literally inserting people who looked like him into the art historical canon. Here, Wiley takes on the military commander Napoleon Bonaparte as painted by Jacques-Louis David.

            "text": "Growing up in South Central Los Angeles during the time of the Rodney King riots, Kehinde Wiley was acutely aware of how Black people, and Balck men in particular, were represented and understood. \u201cI know how young Black men are seen. They\u2019re boys, scared little boys oftentimes. I was one of them.\u201d In galleries and museums, however, places which denote and themselves create cultural importance, he said he spent a lot of time \u2018staring at white flesh\u2019. \u2728\nUpon graduating from his MFA at Yale, Wiley moved to NYC to begin an artist in residence program at The Studio Museum in Harlem. While walking in the area one day, he came across a discarded police mug shot of a young Black man. The contrast to the regal, powerful, and agentic representations of white men he was used to studying and reproducing was jarring. This lead to Wiley\u2019s practice of \u2018street casting\u2019, where he scouts his models on the city streets, and his first major series \u2018Passing/Posing\u2019. In this series, Wiley would work with the models to select poses and gestures of famous works of European art, from the Renaissance to later European political portraits.\n@kehindewiley\n\u2728\n1) 'Femme Piqu\u00e9e par in Serpent' (2008)\n.\n2) 'Triple Portrait of Charles I' (2007)\n.\n3) 'Indio Cuauhtemoc' (2017) .\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#kehindewiley #femmepiqueeparunserpent\n#arthistory #notyurmuse #art\n#discoverunder1k #blackartists #charlesthefirst #contemporaryart #brooklynmuseum",

            "text": "Thunderous applause for Kehinde Wiley @brooklynmuseum. He was introduced with a quote from his interview with @trevornoah.  One of Wileys remarks during his talk was that \u201ccontemporary art doesn\u2019t do more than point\u201d - adding \u201call I do is point to things of value and grace.\u201d What was personally interesting to me is the extent to which almost all of Wileys art is social commentary - and how he has chosen to apply his talent and classical training (\u201cthe rules\u201d) to make poignant and important statements about our society. Hearing him talk about who he is helped me understand and appreciate why he does what he does. Kehinde is a superstar artist - off the charts - but without any of the slick glib presentation of some art celebrities. And he absolutely nailed that Obama portrait. One of the best portraits ever done.  This was a very thoughtful conversation. Wiley is brilliant at connecting the art historical past with today\u2019s reality - so the only open question is in 100 - 200 years will he be considered a masterful practitioner of trenchant social commentary of this era or will his art stand the test  of time - beyond being a gimmick or dismissed as contemporary social journalism - a real risk. Or perhaps both? (Wiley made the case that even guys like Rothko and Pollock, by painting these gigantic canvases, were making statements about power and domination - something that resonates today in other areas like sculpture - where macho art that is XXL and overtakes the architecture and even the landscape is what our society reverences and what the artists aspire to - both men and women!)... comments welcome...\n#brooklynmuseum \n#brooklyntalks \n#kehindewiley \n#artiststalk \n#artcriticism \n#hiltonals\n#artassocialcommentary\n#yaleschoolofart \n#yaleartgallery \n#sanfranciscoartinstitute \n#frenchembassy \n#arthistory\n#obamaportrait \n#rumorsofwar \n#heroicart",

            "text": "The Quarter \nMaybe the problem is that I got involved with the wrong crowd of gods when I was seven. At first they weren't harmful and only showed themselves as fish, birds, especially herons and loons, turtles, a bobcat and a small bear, but not deer and rabbits who only offered themselves as food. And maybe I spent too much time inside the water of lakes and rivers. Underwater seemed like the safest church I could go to. And sleeping outside that young might have seeped too much dark into my brain and bones. It was not for me to ever recover. The other day I found a quarter in the driveway I lost at the Mecosta County Fair in 1947 and missed out on five rides including the Ferris wheel and the Tilt-A-Whirl. I sat in anger for hours in the bull barn mourning my lost quarter on which the entire tragic history of earth is written. I looked up into the holes of the bulls' massive noses and at the brass rings puncturing their noses which allowed them to be led. It would have been an easier life if I had allowed a ring in my nose, but so many years later I still find the spore of the gods here and there but never in the vicinity of quarters. \nJim Harrison\n\nIn Search of Small Gods \nCopper Canyon Press #poetrycommunity #poetryofinstagram #poetrylovers #poetryporn #poetryislife #poems#presidentsday #presidents #jimharrison #coins #gods #kehindewiley #wiley",

            "text": "CXA ON VIEW: \u2018The Yellow Wallpaper\u2019 by Kehinde Wiley, at the William Morris Gallery.\n\nThe Yellow Wallpaper\u2019 is the first solo exhibition of new work shown by Wiley at a UK museum as well as the first to feature exclusively female portraits. The exhibit features women that the artist met on the streets of Dalston and offers a visual response to American novelist Charlotte Perkins Gilman\u2019s acclaimed feminist text, The Yellow Wallpaper (1892). In Wiley\u2019s new portraits, each woman is positioned as autonomous, as powerful, as open to individual interpretation and as an emblem of strength within a society of complicated social networks. They wholly embody myriad positions with regard to social class, status, religion, colonialism and the negotiation of gender.\n\nFor over fifteen years Wiley has sourced William Morris\u2019s iconic floral designs for his paintings. Building on his interest in the relationship between the human body and the decorative, Wiley\u2019s models are depicted in reimagined fields inspired by the William Morris oeuvre. Wiley\u2019s portraits offer a rubric through which to engage with the beautiful yet fraught histories and traditions that black women \u2014 and all women \u2014 are heir to.\n\nFeatured Images: \u2018The Yellow Wallpaper\u2019 at the William Morris Gallery, UK.\n\n@kehindewiley\n@charlotteperkinsgilman\n@morrisgallery\n@stephenfriedmangallery\n\u2014\u2014\n#kehindewiley #williammorris\n#charlotteperkinsgilman #dalston\n#williammorrisgallery #theyellowwallpaper\n#feministart #stephenfriedmangallery",

            "text": "The Quarter \nMaybe the problem is that I got involved with the wrong crowd of gods when I was seven. At first they weren't harmful and only showed themselves as fish, birds, especially herons and loons, turtles, a bobcat and a small bear, but not deer and rabbits who only offered themselves as food. And maybe I spent too much time inside the water of lakes and rivers. Underwater seemed like the safest church I could go to. And sleeping outside that young might have seeped too much dark into my brain and bones. It was not for me to ever recover. The other day I found a quarter in the driveway I lost at the Mecosta County Fair in 1947 and missed out on five rides including the Ferris wheel and the Tilt-A-Whirl. I sat in anger for hours in the bull barn mourning my lost quarter on which the entire tragic history of earth is written. I looked up into the holes of the bulls' massive noses and at the brass rings puncturing their noses which allowed them to be led. It would have been an easier life if I had allowed a ring in my nose, but so many years later I still find the spore of the gods here and there but never in the vicinity of quarters. \nJim Harrison\n\nIn Search of Small Gods \nCopper Canyon Press #poetrycommunity #poetryofinstagram #poetrylovers #poetryporn #poetryislife #poems#presidentsday #presidents #jimharrison #coins #gods #kehindewiley #wiley",

Heard his work quality and detail of brushstroke improved significantly after Beijing studio came into play.\n\nIf this practice becomes widespread, more artists will be simply focusing on purely having a compelling and story-worthy identity, showmanship, fashion show, and gallery dinner hopping, leaving the production of paintings and sculptures to China, Vietnam, and the Philippines and other developing countries. \nOh, wait, it\u2019s already happening. \ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude48\ud83d\ude48 I don\u2019t know how is Chloe Wise partying every day and night still get those paintings done, maybe also a studio with 50 assistants/workers in China?\n\n#NjidekaAkunyiliCrosby\n#TschabalalaSelf\n#GlennLowry\n#NathanielMaryQuinn\n#CalvinMarcus\n#AdamParkerSmith\n#AlexIsrael\n#HaroldAncart\n#NicoleEisenman\n#JonathanGardner\n#CheyenneJulien\n#AverySinger\n#JenniferGuidi\n#JonathanLyndonChase\n#GenieveFiggis\n#EmmanuelPerrotin\n#SpruethMagers\n#JavierCalleja\n#TomooGokita\n#NinaChanelAbney\n#Janivaellis\n#loiehowell\n#RichardPrince\n#Gagosian\n#ArtBasel\n#FriezeArtFair\n#HauserWirth\n#KehindeWiley",

Featuring six new large-scale female portraits, the exhibition offers a visual response to American novelist #CharlottePerkinsGilman's acclaimed feminist text, '#TheYellowWallpaper', 1892. \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nWiley explains, \"\u2018The Yellow Wallpaper' is a work of literary fiction that explores the contours of femininity & insanity. This exhibition seeks to use the language of the decorative to reconcile #blackness, #gender, and a beautiful & terrible past.\"\n________\nGilman's text is a semi-autobiographical tale which sees her narrator confined to her bedroom after being diagnosed with hysteria and explores the disastrous consequences of denying women independence. These new portraits feature women that the artist met on the streets of Dalston, East London. Viewed fr below in three-quarter view, the figures gaze directly at the viewer from a lavishly patterned background. Wiley employs the heroic visual vocabulary of traditional portraiture to position the subjects as autonomous, powerful & emblems of strength within a society of complicated social networks. Recalling a style once used almost exclusively to depict white aristocratic subjects, these portraits distil a complex dialogue about race & identity in a post-colonial age. 'The Yellow Wallpaper' runs through Monday 25 May.\n________\nFirst work is my Favorite \ud83d\ude0d \u2018Portrait of Asia-Imani, Gabriella-Esnae, and Kaya Palmer\u2019, 2020.

            "text": "Since, Wiley has become known for his portrayal of balck and brown bodies set against vibrant, gaudy backgrounds. Both a stylistic and a political choice, this removes the model from any context, allowing the viewer to imagine their own surroundings with a focus on the model specifically. \u2728\nIn recent years Wiley has begun to branch out in both medium and subject matter. His portrayals of women now include the famous \u2018Judith and Holofernes\u2019, a topic made famous in European art by Caravaggio, Artemisia Gentileschi and others. In 2019 Wiley created his first public monument, \u2018Rumors of War\u2019. Based on the 1907 statue of confederate general J.E.B. Stuart, \u2018Rumors of War\u2019 instead places a young Black man on the horse, striking a triumphant pose. A direct response to the ongoing conflict surrounding confederate monuments in the United-States, \u2018Rumors of War\u2019 is now on view permanently outside the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. \u2728\nIn 2015 Wiley was commissioned for what would become his most famous work, the presidential portrait of Barack Obama. Now on view at the Smithsonian alongside Amy Sherald\u2019s painting of Michelle Obama, these two works are set to go on a year long tour of the US from June 2021.\n@kehindewiley\n\u2728\n1) 'Judith and Holofernes' (2012)\n.\n2) 'Rumors of War' (2019)\n.\n3) 'President Barack Obama' (2018)\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n.\n#kehindewiley #barackobama #smithsonian #judithslayingholofernes\n#judithandholofernes #rumorsofwar\n#virginiamuseumoffinearts\n#contemporaryart #amysherald #michelleobama\n#brooklynmuseum #arthistory #discoverunder1k #art",

Working in portraiture, the American artist Kehinde Wiley combines traditional formats and motifs with modern modes of representation. Firmly situating himself within art history\u2019s portrait tradition, he selects pieces from old masters such as Rubens or Titian and replaces the subjects with handsome young black men. His representation of urban black men employs the visual rhetoric of the heroic, powerful and majestic. Often blurring the boundaries between traditional and modern modes of representation, he emphasizes the established portrayal of masculinity and physicality connected to the representation of black young men. Initially based on the photographs taken on the streets of Harlem, his practice now includes models found in urban landscapes all around the world. Exploring the complicated socio-political histories, he places young black men within the field of power.\n\u2022\n\u2022\nI was also introduced to his work through @art21. Our concepts are pretty different. However, I admire his approach to classical art, by bringing black men to the forefront. He really focuses on the softness of black men that isn\u2019t usually depicted. Representation is everything and everyone has a voice.\n\u2022\n\u2022\nFeatured images: Kehinde Wiley, via wsj.com; Kehinde Wiley \u2013 Kern Alexander Study I, 2011\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\n\n#blackcontemporaryart #painting #classicalart #blackmen #photography #portaiture #enlightenment #blackandwhitephotography \n#blackart #art #blackartist #artist #blackgirlmagic #artwork #melanin #contemporaryart #instillation #blackartists #installationart  #blackwork #contemporaryartist #black #kehindewiley #blackhistorymonth #representationalart",
