#washingtondc was the first place I wanted to go when I got back to the U.S. from Vietnam. Did you know that nearly 60,000 ‘muricans died during the conflict? They are listed on the #VietnamVeteransMemorial. I’ve always thought it’s one of the best memorials I’ve seen. #mayalin designed it to look like a gash in the soil, like the war was in the U.S.’s #history, and visitors can see their  #reflection in the names of the dead. #ushistory #architecture #design #landscapearchitecture #granite #monument
