Rubbing courtesy of the VVMF (Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund). My distant relative, US Navy Commander Terry A. Dennison, was a fighter pilot who was shot down and killed in Vietnam in 1966. He was also a member of the Blue Angels aerobatic team. His grandfather and my great great grandfather were brothers. #vietnamveteran #vvmf #rubbing #vietnamveteransmemorial #vietnamveteransmemorialwall #genealogy-workout
