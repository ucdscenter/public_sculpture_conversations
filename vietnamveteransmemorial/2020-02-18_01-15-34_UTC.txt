Our day-trip to Washington D.C. was exhausting but amusing. We slept like 4 hours after a 4 hour drive from New York (do not recommend doing that after 2 flights). We started our tour from the White House and  the first thing we saw was police blocking the streets. We got curious and waited to see why they were doing it. Like 10 minutes later we saw a caravan of very luxury black cars with heavy armed people and in one of the cars there was Donald Trump. First thing to see in DC, not bad! The police was very nice, they let us pass, and they let us stay. We continued walking among all the memorials. The weather was very rainy those days, but it didn‚Äôt disturb our walk. After walking through the memorials we headed to the part with Smithsonian museums. We were planning to leave early as another 4 hour drive was waiting for us, so we didn‚Äôt have time to see all the museums. We were able to see the Holocaust Museum, Natural History Museum, and Air and Space Museum. We were extremely tired after all but we saw pretty much everything we planned and it was enough for 1 day. Washington seemed to me very clean and rational city. We didn‚Äôt see many people there. Even with school tours it was spacious and not crowded. I will definitely come back for more museum sight seeing one day as it has so many great museums in one place üèõüõ£ #washingtondc #mettrumpeventhoughwedidntwantto #smithsonian #smithsonianmuseums #whitehouse #worldwar2memorial #reflectingpool #lincolnmuseum #vietnamveteransmemorial #koreanwarveteransmemorial #martinlutherkingjrmemorial #roosveltmemorial #tidalbasin #jeffersonmemorial #washingtonmonument #thenationalmall #holocaustmemorialmuseum #naturalhistorymuseum #airandspacemuseum #capitol #castroeybina #wewillbeback #worthit
