Thankful for our independence and the service and sacrifice of those who made it possible. One of the highlights of my life was the privilege of joining my dad on the @starsandstripeshonorflight two years ago. Thank you to all the men and women who have served our country and those who organized this incredible trip! #honorflightmilwaukee #starsandstripeshonorflight #navy #army #marines #airforce #coastguard #nationalguard #independenceday #4thofjuly #thankful #blessed #washingtondc #vietnamveteransmemorial #koreanwarmemorial #worldwartwomemorial #usa #godblessamerica
