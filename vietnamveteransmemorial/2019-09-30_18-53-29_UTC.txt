Such an #honor and #privilege to be part of such an amazing #dedication #memorial for our #fallen and missing #heroes who #served in #vietnam I met so many amazing people. Truly touched by the whole experience! From being asked to raise our countryâ€™s flag, to marching with all the fellow Veterans and then receiving my women Veterans pin. Feeling so proud and blessed.
