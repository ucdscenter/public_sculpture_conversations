@mai_h_koontz and I are extremely thankful for those who risked their lives to fight in the Vietnam War. Without y'all, my wife, @mai_h_koontz , her family, and others, would not be able to call Texas or any part of the United States their home today. I wouldn't have been able to marry her, much less meet her. So, thank you @vietnamveterans for everything. Thankyou for allowing me to marry the one woman whom I will love forever.
