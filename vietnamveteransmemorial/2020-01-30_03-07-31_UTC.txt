The Vietnam Veterans Memorial. It is heartbreaking to look upon the names of over 58,000 soldiers (most under 20 years old) who died in this war and whose names are engraved on the wall. You’ll never be the same after seeing it. It tears you up one side and down the other. We cried 🇺🇸🙏 Thank you soldiers and nurses. The nurses statue is beautiful. You all are heroes. #vietnamveteransmemorial #vietnamwar #usa #washingtondc #america #vietnamwarnursesmemorial
