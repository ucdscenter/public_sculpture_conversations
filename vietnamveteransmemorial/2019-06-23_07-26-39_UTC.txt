A new shirt design I just finished. I designed this shirt in honor of my dad who was in the Special Forces in Vietnam. Since his 76th birthday is this July I wanted to give him
a shirt I designed honoring his service. This will be up for sale on amazon this week if you want to get one for someone you know who gave up their freedom to secure yours.
