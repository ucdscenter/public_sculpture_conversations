In Memory of... I was trying to find the right day to post this picture. I missed Veterans Day and have been waiting for some appropriate holiday. I figured Columbius Day was close. I really liked this shot of the Vietnam Memorial in Washington DC. It was a combination of the beautiful red flowers against the reflective black memorial with the names of the soldiers who gave their lives. I also am a sucker for shallow depth of field. I think the blurred background works especially well to focus you attention on the rose and the writing on the wall. amera: Canon 40D, Lens: EF 28-135 f/3.5-5.6L IS I, Focal length: 112mm.
