We took time yesterday to place a special "peace" rock at the base of the Clinton County Vietnam Veterans Memorial, which was dedicated in 1987. It is fitting that the memorial was placed in the southeast corner of the Clinton County Courthouse lawn. The feelings this monument stirs inside you is unforgettable. While there, we took a selfie using the black granite as a mirror. Memories made.
