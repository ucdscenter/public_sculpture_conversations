Sunrise on the #NationalMall (@nationalmallnps) is a special time. In the heart of a bustling city, walking the paths of hallowed war memorials and watching colors streak the sky above the Washington Monument feels peaceful and solemn. It offers a connection to history that few other places can evoke. Inspired by the brilliance and bravery of our patriots and leaders, it’s easy to be deeply moved by reading their words and remembering their stories.
