"The depth would be enough to offer you refuge, but not enough to become oppressive. That it had always to be of human scale and that as you descend, the names rise up to meet you." â€”Maya Lin
The memorial speaks to visitors young and old, and allows them to see themselves reflected in the past. It gives visitors the chance to come face to face with loss, reflect, and remember. (ðŸ“¸: @anaohlandtphotography)
