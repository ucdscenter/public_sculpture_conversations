We were asked to help with the fundraising efforts to complete the building of the interpretive center at Freedom Park in South Sioux City Nebraska.  We were honored to do so and happy to say these boards were able to raise over $1000 last night at
the South Sioux City Chamber of Commerce Annual Banquet.

This park is home to the only permanent half size replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall and also has a large dog park in memory of fallen U.S. Navy Petty Officer First Class John Douangdara and his dog Bart who were killed in a helicopter ambush in Afghanistan on August 11th, 2011 along with 30 other heroes. 
Please make a donation so that we are able to complete this project at
