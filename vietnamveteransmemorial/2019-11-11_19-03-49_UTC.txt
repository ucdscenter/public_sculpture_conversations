You never needed a uniform to be a hero ❤️ Thank you for everything you have done 💯 As I remember you today, like I do most days, mistakes & all, thank you Dad. For teaching me all you have especially when the chips were down is our character & integrity. I don’t always get it right, but it sure as hell is fun 🤩 #UnitedStatesNavy #vietnamveteransmemorial
