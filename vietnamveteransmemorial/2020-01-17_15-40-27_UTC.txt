"Early Monday morning I arrived at The Wall before the visitors and was able to take some pictures," Wall Volunteer Michael Mc Mahon said about snapping these beautiful photos in the January cold. Michael, who lives in New Jersey, makes the trek to Washington, D.C. throughout the year to remember his fallen brothers and sisters and educate visitors. Michael, like many of our Wall Volunteers, is a veteran himself. He was drafted into the U.S. Army in January 1969 and served in the Mekong Delta region with the 9th Infantry Division from June 1969 to June 1970. He is also a tour guide at the New Jersey Vietnam Veterans' Memorial Foundation. "I always have a peaceful feeling at the Memorial, especially in the quiet of the morning," he added.
