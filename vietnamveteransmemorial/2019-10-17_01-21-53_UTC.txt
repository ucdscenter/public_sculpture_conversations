We closed out Mumâ€™s Birthday with a BBQ dinner at the restaurant of a celebrity pitmaster & an illumination tour of a couple of Washington DC monuments. We visited the JFK Centre For Performing Arts, WW2 Veterans Memorial & the Martin Luther King Jnr Memorial. We were also lucky enough to get an amazing view of the Washington Monument.  #familyholiday #familyadventure #travel #usa #october2019 #wanderlust #pitmaster #bbq #washingtondc #jfkcentrefortheperformingarts #vietnamveteransmemorial #martinlutherkingjnrmemorial #washingtonmonument
