We live on the other side of the park so we have to make a decision, walk to the bridge and go back, walk to the helicopter and go back, or walk to the water wheel and look at the animals and go allllll the way around. My 3 little boys have been more ambitious this year and have wanted to see it all. Did you know that Saturn playground is on the other side? We also play there every day as long as it isn't raining. But if we've walked the whole path they probably only play 10 minutes and then ask to walk home. Lol!",

We had already made a stop at another playground previously so my kids were \"done\" by the time we reached the helicopter haha..
