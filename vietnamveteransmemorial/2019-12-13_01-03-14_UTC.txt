Check out my new book on Amazon, Tears and Triumphs: Tales of Loyalty and Betrayal from a Military Life.
.
This is my memoir that includes my experiences as a Vietnam veteran, quality consultant, and musician. It includes stories from my childhood on a rural homestead to serving my country in the United States Army, including two tours in Vietnam. .
.
It traces my earliest influencesâ€”from the joys of a close-knit family to abuse by a Catholic priestâ€”through my family life, wartime experiences, my return to music as a means of healing Vietnam wounds, and my current focus as a performing artist with an international following of fellow Vietnam vets.
