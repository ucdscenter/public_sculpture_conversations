Illinois Congressman Paul Findley, who recently passed away at age 98, had a role in what became one of the most-read Congressional Records ever.

A critic of American involvement in Vietnam, Findley requested that the Record include the names of 35,000 American soldiers who died in Vietnam. More than 100,000 copies of the Record were printed, and it became one of the most-requested items from GPO. GPO continued to add names of additional fallen soldiers to the Congressional Record every six months.

This list was then used to inscribe the name of every American killed in Vietnam onto the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington D.C.

See the names starting on page 7405 of the Record produced by GPO on govinfo: bit.ly/2mezjMU
