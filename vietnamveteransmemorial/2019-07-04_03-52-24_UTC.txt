What you can't see are all the names of the ones who gave their lives in the Vietnam War.
What you can't see are the grown men sorrowfully holding onto the wall and remembering their friends that gave their lives.
What you can't see is my dad's name...because it's not up there.
Many people aren't so lucky.
The reality hit me that if his name had been up there, I wouldn't be here.
Sobering.
This one got me right in the feels.
