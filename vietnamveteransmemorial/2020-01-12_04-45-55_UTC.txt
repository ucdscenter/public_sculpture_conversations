Vietnam Veterans Memorial Plaza, Financial District, Water Street. This is a beautiful and peaceful memorial to those NYC residents who were killed in the war. What is especially moving is the glass wall which has excerpts of letters home by the soldiers etched into it. #nyc #nycthings #vietnamveteransmemorial #nyctransplant #nycadventures
