For his action this day in 1965 - in the Iron Triangle northwest of Saigon - Specialist Five Lawrence Joel, a medic with the 1st Battalion, 503rd Airborne Infantry, 173rd Airborne Brigade earned the Medal of Honor. 
His unit was outnumbered in an enemy force attack, but despite suffering a severe leg wound Specialist Joel continued to administer aid to his wounded comrades. Seriously wounded a second time—with a bullet lodged deep in his lungs—Joel continued to treat the wounded, completely disregarding the battle raging around him and his own safety. Even after the 24-hour battle had subsided, Joel, a 38-year-old father of two, continued to treat and comfort the wounded until his own evacuation was ordered.

He became  the first living African American since the Spanish-American War to receive USA's highest and most prestigious personal military decoration,  awarded to recognize service members who have distinguished themselves by acts of valor
