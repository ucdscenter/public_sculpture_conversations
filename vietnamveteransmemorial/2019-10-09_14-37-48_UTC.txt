On a visit this week, @mylesmartin23 was able to pay his respects to his great uncle U.S. Army SSGT Roland "Duke" Manuel, who fell on Nov. 21, 1967 at age 26. Myles had this photo taken of himself touching Roland's name on Panel 30E, Line 57. "He was not only a Staff Sergeant, but he was a leader as well. I think this is where my leadership skills stem from," Myles wrote in a post and he continued, "as I continue to make him and my ancestors proud."

Millions of hands have touched this Wall, but few as loving as a family member. Thank you to everyone who has had the opportunity to visit the Memorial to remember the lives cut short. 58,276 names are inscribed on this Wall, but the lives of many more were changed forever.
