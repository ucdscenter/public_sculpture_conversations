Yesterday morning, I went to visit the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington DC at sunrise.  It was one of those rare occasions when I was there all alone and there was nobody along the entire wall but me and the names of the 58,000 brave Americans who gave their life for their country.  Very humbling experience to say the least. 
I captured a photo of the statue of the three soldiers at the beginning of the path leading up to the wall, and then a photo of the wall itself, and thought to myself that it would look so amazing to combine the two images together, almost as if the soldiers were ghosts from years past coming to life along the wall.  Here is my vision captured below. 
All alone there, just the sound of my footsteps and the birds chirping in the morning breeze, I felt such a deep gratitude for all the brave men and women who sacrificed their lives for our country.  I know the photo cannot possibly describe what I felt that morning, but I hope it does a little bit.
