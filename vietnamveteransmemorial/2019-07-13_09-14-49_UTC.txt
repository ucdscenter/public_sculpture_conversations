“The Wall That Heals” this evening. This is a 3/4 scale replica of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington DC that travels around the country and stopped in my town this weekend. A sobering and poignant visit for me. Although this wasn’t my war, I can certainly appreciate their sacrifice. Enjoyed trading stories with the other veterans in attendance though. Military service is kind of like a family I guess. It spans generations and has its own unique bond. I wouldn’t trade that for anything. To all that served, welcome home. To those we’ve lost, may you never be forgotten. #thewallthatheals #vietnamveteransmemorial #vietnamwarmemorial #vietnamwar #usarmy #usmc #usaf #usnavy #uscg
