(2/18/1995) Two 247-foot long walls of black granite meet at a 125-degree angle, tapering from a height of ten feet to a few inches. One end points to the Washington Monument and the other to the Lincoln Memorial. The 58,156 names of the slain and missing are carved into the black granite walls, creating a quiet place to remember and honor all Vietnam Veterans. The names are arranged by date, starting in 1959 and ending in 1975. A sculpture of three servicemen in combat gear stands nearby, a graphic reminder of the Vietnam Experience.
