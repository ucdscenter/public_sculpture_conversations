@vietnamveteransorg @washingtonpost @visitwashingtondc @vocroc @americanveteranscenter I had the pleasure of meeting this gentleman, who is a Vietnam Veteran. This was he first time visiting the wall. He came to pay respect to his fellow platoon members and etch each their names on paper in remembrance. May God bless him ❤️ #vietnamveteransmemorial #veteransmemorial #vietnamveterans #military #respect #washington_dc #moving #somber #momentofsilence
