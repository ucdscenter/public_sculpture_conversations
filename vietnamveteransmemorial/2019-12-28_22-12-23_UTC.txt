Today is a travel day for us and we are grateful for the 67 degree weather in NC. Last year at this time, it was in the 30’s and snowing. We stopped for lunch and our rest area stop was a somber reminder to stop and be even more grateful for our freedom and our service men and women. I saw the NC and American Flag and went over to see what the flags were flying over. At this rest area, we happened upon the North Carolina Vietnam Veterans Memorial and we stood there in awe and appreciation as we read “Dedicated to the 216,000 North Carolinians who served and the over 1,600 who were killed or missing in the Vietnam War”. Lost but not forgotten....#vietnamveteransmemorial #ncvietnamveteransmemorialpark #thankyouforyourservice
