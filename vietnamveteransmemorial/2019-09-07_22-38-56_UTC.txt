“Harsh Realities of War”
The Vietnam Veterans Memorial in the State of Washington.  My Uncle, Sonny Porter, died serving this country during the Korean War & my father, Alfred Garnes, received a Purple Heart during the Vietnam War. Mad respect for all of those courageous souls who served this country respectfully & humanely with integrity. #makelovenotwar #alllifematters #washingtonstate #socialcommentary #politicalart #michaelgarnes #olympiawashington #statecapital #vietnamveteransmemorial #vintagetoys #hellaphotoproductions #olympiawa #wartoys #romanticizingviolence #truepatriots #altruism #communityactivist #ultimatesacrifice #armedforces #ww1 #ww2 #koreanwar #vietnamwar #afganistanwar #armynavyairforcemarines #iraqwar #americanrevolution #thecivilwar.
