I’m honored to announce that our documentary on the #Vietnamwar and the #vietnamveteransmemorial in Angel Fire, titled, “On This Hallowed Ground” will be airing on KOB, Sunday, November 10th at 8am before “meet the press”. I can’t even begin to express how exciting this all is!  If you’ve never been to the David Westphall Vietnam Memorial in Angel Fire, New Mexico you need to go!  It’s an amazing story of how it came to be. #loveforourveterans #nmtrue #honorourvets #veteransday #broadcast #broadcast_nm @sarahkanafani @boxlightfilms @smkanafani #boxlightfilms #luminancepictures #womenfilmmakers #womendp #dp #cinematographer #womandirector
