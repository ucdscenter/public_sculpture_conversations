On this Veteranâ€™s Day, Iâ€™d like to express gratitude to those who have served the US and to honor those who have died as a result of their service. Specifically, Iâ€™d like to take the time to recognize & remember those who served in Vietnam & who sadly returned home to extreme mistreatment & scorn. Despite the great cost of this terrible war, I am forever grateful for these veterans & for the USA for standing up for the protection of democratic principles and human freedoms.

Freedom is very personal to me b/c my family has had to fled communism or endure it. Both my grandpa & uncle helped American forces during the Vietnam War as a Physician Assistant & Navy Captain, while my cousin has served in the US Army & Air Force. While my uncle and dad were successful in escaping communism, my grandpa was sent to re-education camp, where my grandma was almost buried alive for visiting him. After the war, my grandparents lost everything, their homes in flames. Growing up in a post-war era w/out her parents around, my mom, the youngest of 11, experienced extreme poverty.

Meanwhile, my uncle & dad decided to risk their lives to flee what they knew would become a depressive communist state. At 18, my dad left his family in the middle of the night to embark on a treacherous journey to freedom. It would be 15 years until he would see them again. My uncle commanded a boat to help 100s of refugees escape. Unfortunately this boat wasnâ€™t designed to hold that many people or to endure harsh waves. My dad witnessed people dying of starvation & dehydration, people being robbed, killed, & raped by Thai pirates. He ended up in a refugee camp in Indonesia where he contracted malaria. After 8 months, a Catholic Church in Winter Haven, FL sponsored my dad over & my mom would later be sponsored by my American grandparents. They both became US citizens as soon as they could & my dad even tried to enlist in the military after 9/11, but couldnâ€™t due to his age.

To honor my family, my American grandparents have created the Miller-Tran endowment for Vietnamese Studies at the University of Michigan. Freedom is not free. Forever grateful to be an American!ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ #GodBlessAmerica
