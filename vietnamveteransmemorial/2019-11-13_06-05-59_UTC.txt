37 years ago today the U.S dedicated one of the most touching and special memorials when they opened up the Vietnam war memorial in Washington D.C. If you've never seen it or visited it you should put it on your list it is sombering yet special, to see all the things that people have brought and placed at the foot of the wall is so touching it will bring most to tears .... I was honored to get to visit in on my one trip to D.C. But would love to go back with my family I've also seen the traveling wall when it came through Gordon county a few years back... there are 58,318 names of soldiers who were either killed or went missing during the years of the war and the memorial is two 10 foot black marble walls with names on each side covering two acres.... like I said it's definitely a memorial worth visiting and paying your respects to the soldiers who gave their lives #vietnamveteransmemorial #thankaveteran
