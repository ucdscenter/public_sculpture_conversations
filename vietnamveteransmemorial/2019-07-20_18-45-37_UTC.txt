Today Bumble visited #thewallthatheals (a traveling 3/4 scale replica of the wall in Washington DC) in our hometown. Geepa served in Vietnam and we made etchings of two of his buddies that had been memorialized here. A local man had an amazing collection of Vietnam memorabilia and Bumble thought the rations looked yummy. ðŸ˜ŠðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
