We had another packed day yesterday! We started with a tour of Ford's Theatre and the Petersen House. It was another sobering experience. The girls were able to earn their Ford's Theatre Junior Ranger badge AND patch! They get excited when they give both to them! 
Then we visited the Vietnam Veterans Memorial (and the girls chose names and did rubbings so we can look them up later), the Lincoln Memorial, the Korean War Veterans Memorial, the DC War Memorial, and the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial. We had the honor of hearing a traveling choir from Kenya singing at the MLK Memorial. It was beautiful!
