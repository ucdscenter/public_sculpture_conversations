The lucky layover. .
.
We thought we only had an hour and a half upon landing at Ronald Reagan. Nope! Turns out we had 3 hours! Our bags were checked complimentary in STL so we only had our backpacks to worry about which made the possibility of leaving easy. After a quick Google search said the National Mall was about 10 min away by car we immediately hoped in an Uber and "did" D.C.. We found Byrd scooters and raced down the Mall and took pictures of the U.S. Capitol building, the Natural History Museum, the Washington Monument, the WWII Memorial (Missouri), the Lincoln Memorial, and my must-see, the Vietnam Veteran's Memorial.

Kyle is like me, he likes to go to say he went, but isn't always interested in going to experience everything to the absolute fullest. Washington D.C. has always been like that for me. I've wanted to go to say I've been, but honestly had little desire to spend a lot of time there. This layover was perfect. I saw what I wanted to see, we got pictures, and returned back to the airport in an hour. If given the chance to visit again for a little while longer I would love to see the Smithsonian and the mint, but for now I'm content with our whirlwind layover adventure.
