This afternoon was MONUMENT-al in our quest of #FreeinDC.  Apparently everyone else had the bright idea to head to DC while schools were off meaning entrance lines to the other museums were wrapped around the buildings by early afternoon.  Decided to try again tomorrow for those and walked around the Mall to see the monuments Brody had on his checklist to view! Walked back past the White House too so we covered our third and final branch of government. Bring your walking shoes if you plan on seeing the monuments - we clocked over 16,000 steps today!
