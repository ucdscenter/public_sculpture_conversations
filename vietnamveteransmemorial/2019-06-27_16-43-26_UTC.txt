Hundreds of thousands of items have been left at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial since 1982. They are personal and intimate. Many speak to the human cost of sacrifice, some give glimpses into the lives of those we lost, and others are pleas of forgiveness. They show the impact of war on a nation. Many items have been picked up by the National Park Service where they have been stored, catalogued and preserved in a warehouse in Maryland. Perishable items like flowers and wreaths are not collected. See a selection of these tributes to the fallen online at: vvmf.org/items .
