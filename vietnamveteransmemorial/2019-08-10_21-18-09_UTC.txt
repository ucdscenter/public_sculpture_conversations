Wanted to share these pictures I got at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington DC. I just wanted to take a picture of the wall to say Iâ€™ve been, but then I noticed this woman etching names from the wall and thought how that man may of been her father or brother or uncle. Then as I was snapping pictures of the woman this young girl saw herself in the reflection and reached out touching one of the names. In my mind it shows how each of the names on the wall is someone just like ourselves that loves this country and paid the ultimate price for the freedom we enjoy today. For that I am grateful and I am posting this in remembrance of those brave men and women. #vietnamwar #vietnamveterans #vietnamveteransmemorial #washingtondc
