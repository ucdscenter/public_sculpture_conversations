Thomas Gerald Dickerson of Thomaston, Georgia, lost his life in Vietnam on November 23, 1968. He was 18 years old. His name is inscribed on Panel 38W, Line 42 of The Wall. He left behind a daughter, Tonya, whom he never met. She was born shortly after he was deployed and has spent a lifetime trying to piece together a picture of him from those who knew him. 
In 2017, Tonya came to Washington, D.C. to read her father's name.Â  She wrote this remembrance on his Wall of Faces page. It read, "Hey Daddy. I finally made it to The Wall, to touch your name. What a healing place. The wound in my heart is no longer gaping and bleeding. I will miss you for the rest of my days. But now I can speak of you without tears. We love you, your grandkids and I. We will ensure that you are never forgotten. Love, as always, your proud daughter, Tonya." She left this basket when she visited. .

This Sunday, a nation will commemorate #FathersDay. And this week we will be sharing the stories of the sons and daughters of the fathers taken too soon and how they have chosen to remember them through The Wall.
