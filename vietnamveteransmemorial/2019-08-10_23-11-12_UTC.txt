On County Road 83 (North Ocean) between the LIE and Middle Country Road you can see Bald Hill. It is a beautiful 100-foot high monument painted red, white, and blue. It is a Vietnam Veterans Memorial and was dedicated on November 11, 1991.

Did you know this is one of the highest elevations on Long Island? In the Bald Hill area it reaches 331 feet according to Wikipedia.

It is a small park but, absolutely beautiful. I highly recommend stopping in to walk the park and see the monument up close.
