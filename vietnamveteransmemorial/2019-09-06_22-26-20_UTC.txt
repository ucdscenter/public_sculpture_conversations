Stopped at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and Museum, with a 24/7 Peace and Brotherhood Chapel, located outside of Angel Fire, NM. The family of a local hero and poet, David Westphall, killed in action, spearheaded this emotionally powerful project. 
When I saw photos of the 101st Airborne division, my father's WWII unit, I was glad that boxes of tissues were liberally available.
