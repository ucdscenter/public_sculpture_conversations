Early morning run to Vietnam Veterans Memorial by land artist and architect Maya Lin.
Designed as a literal and metaphorical cut into American soil, the rising gradient of its walls progressively shelters you as you walk to its center. There, the number of names of those who lost their lives during the Vietnam War peak. There, one can reflect on this â€œwound that is closed and healing". There lies our collective memory.
