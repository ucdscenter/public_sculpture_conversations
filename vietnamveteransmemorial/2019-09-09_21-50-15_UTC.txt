Spent some time at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall in DC on Saturday.  Very emotional for me. Took me straight to gratitude for my friends that served and made it home (Jay, Ken and others) because so many did not.  Also, took me to my knees by the sheer magnitude of the loss. 
War has real cost.  Thank you to all who have served, for your sacrifices and for your protection.
