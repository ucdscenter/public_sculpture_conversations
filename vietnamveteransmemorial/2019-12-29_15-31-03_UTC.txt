Hi. It's Jeff @coseedphoto here along for the ride this week. Let's work together to uphold the greatness normally filling this feed. The close of the calendar year is a natural time to reflect; I propose we do just that over the next 6 days. Ask yourself / share with us :⁣⁣
⁣⁣
What is the most significant image you made in the last twelve months?⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Tag #thebeautifulreal_reflect and include in your caption an explanation of the significance. Perhaps it marked a life milestone. Or got published. Or sparked a ginormous client order. Or helped someone heal. Or is the first image you made for yourself in too long. Or won an award. Or absolutely, positively failed - the byproduct of a seemingly brilliant idea poorly executed (I made quite a few of these this year) - but which moved your work forward! Or something else entirely. You tell us.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
For a little kicker this week, between now and next Saturday 3 shares from #thebeautifulreal_reflect will be selected to receive an archival pigment print of their most significant image. For you to do with as you please - frame and hang at home, gift, tape to the ceiling above your bed so it haunts you when you fall asleep/wake-up, or use to hone your dart game. Whatever works for you.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Dig deep. Let's see what you've got.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
To get the ball rolling, a couple images of my daughter. My reflection on these images in the comments below.
