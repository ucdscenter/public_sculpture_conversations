I discovered this shot in my #GooglePhotos when I was looking for the last image I posted; I like how it came out, but realized I never shared it, so here we are. This was taken while touring the monuments and memorials in Washington DC with @urbanadventures last February. It was such a treat to have this normally crowded site all to ourselves!

I take pictures all the time, especially when I travel. I do it for fun and to capture memories, but also to share with the world ðŸ¥° I use Instagram as a visual diary of sorts, and I'm grateful to have it as an outlet.

It's tricky, though, to walk the line between sharing and oversharing. The majority of the photos I take, and even a lot of the ones I intend to post, never make it up because I don't want to ~spam~ my friends with too much #content. But as the @instagram algorithm continues to change, throttling and hiding more and more people's stuff, I'm sort of over whatever etiquette rules I'm supposed to be following. (I'm not trying to be famous, you guys, but I do appreciate the "likes" and occasional encouraging comment ðŸ˜© IG getting rid of likes is a lame cop out -- how about you actually show our photos to our followers? But I digress.)
