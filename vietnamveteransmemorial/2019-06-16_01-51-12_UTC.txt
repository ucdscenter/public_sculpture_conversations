We traveled this weekend to DC to honor my dad. It was a whirlwind of a weekend and we are already back home- but we cherished every moment there. •

We were invited to attend the Vietnam Veteran’s Memorial, In memory of the men and women who served in the Vietnam War and later died as a result of their service ❤️💙 Our family was grateful to be able to attend and be a part of this special celebration today- we love and miss you everyday, Dad.
