No More Pain | Today, we’ve determined fathers are heroes for the things they go through to keep their loved ones safe, sound & without pain. These men listed on the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, some fathers, are our super duper heroes, going through a special sort of fright and pain that we can’t understand; they took on pain so that you wouldn’t have to. They did it so that we all could have a better future & keep their country safe. Wherever you are, however you feel, know these people - and others like them living today - are here for you to help you feel less pain. As always, this includes all of us at the RosiePups Project. -Super Steve & Mama Rose, Caped Co-Founders
