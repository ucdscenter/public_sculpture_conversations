My 4 year old has more volunteer hours than a lot of adults I know. She supervised putting up the traveling Vietnam Wall yesterday and even drove in a few stakes herself. And looked adorable rocking her TMC blue in the process! ðŸ’™ #whvets2019 #themissioncontinues #teamrwb #support #vietnamveteransmemorial #koreanwarmemorial
