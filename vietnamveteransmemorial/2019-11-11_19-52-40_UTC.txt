Each time I see veterans events I always notice Vietnamese-Americans showing their pride and gratitude for the U.S. military. Many South Vietnamese were persecuted by the North for being “blood enemies of the revolution.” Many fled the South after the North invaded and went to the United States to become entrepreneurs, leaders, civil servants, and citizens. #vietnamveteransmemorial #veteransday
