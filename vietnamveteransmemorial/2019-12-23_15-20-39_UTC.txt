On Friday, I had the pleasure of cutting the ribbon on the new Queens Veterans Memorial at Elmhurst Park. I stood alongside BP #melindakatz Parks Commissioner @mitchell_silver , and Chapter 32 of the Vietnam Veterans of Queens to commemorate the fallen, POWs, and MIAs that risked their lives for our country. This is a wonderful commemorative and educational addition to Elmhurst Park with 371 names who died during the war. Did you know that Queens has the most veteranâ€™s of all the boroughs? 59,000 by the latest count.
