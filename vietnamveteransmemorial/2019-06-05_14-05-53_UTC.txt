It is unbelievable how profound and moving and sorrowful it is to walk along the #vietnamveteransmemorial & touch it and see those thousands and thousands of names and think what a tragic waste of life. Somehow this wall elicits deep emotion. It was and I suppose still is controversial to some - criticized as a “black gash of shame and sorrow”....well, that’s what the war was and it is heartbreaking to think that so many lives were sacrificed when presidents and politicians (of both parties) knew it was unwinnable and useless but wanted to “save face”. (The shame is theirs, not those who paid the ultimate price.) Then to read Lincoln’s Second Inaugural Address inscribed on the north wall of his Memorial and to think of how much better we can be as a nation: “Fondly do we hope, fervently do we pray, that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said "the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether. With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness in the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nation's wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations.  #lincolnmonument #nationalmall
