My brother was able to take this picture of my dad standing in front of the #VietnamVeteransMemorial wall. It speaks volumes to see someone who served our country standing in front of so many individuals that lost their lives for our freedom. I’m very proud of my dad and I’m also very grateful for all the service men and women who give it their all for my #Freedom. #ProudToBeAnAmerican #GodBlessAmerica #GodBlessOurVeterans #StandForTheFlag
