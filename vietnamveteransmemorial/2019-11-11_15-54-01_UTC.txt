While in DC for a week mid October we spent our second day visiting the war memorials on the National Mall specifically the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall. It had been on our bucket list as John fought in that war during the early 1970’s. He served alongside 4 men/friends who were killed. His goal was to touch each of their names on the wall. Using the directory books, which give you the exact wall coordinates to find a name, the first name we found was Wheeler D. Brooks who was killed June 20, 1971. He is the man in the goggles in the first photo. My husband John, pictured to the right of Brooks, the tallest one with all the ammunition strapped across his chest. The helicopters they flew in were open and dusty. Brooks wore goggles to keep his eyes clean since he was the first man out of the helicopter and needed to see what lay ahead. Brooks was John’s squad leader whom he replaced after Brooks was killed. 
Thank you to all the men and women who served our country throughout history. Thank you to John who fought in a very unpopular war. I hope you finally feel thanked by our nation many years later.
