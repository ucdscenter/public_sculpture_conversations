My mom says he was never the same after coming home. I never really knew what happened until after he died at 49. I was 21. One of his Army friends told me how a group of his buddies were killed by a bomb that a kid they had met & took care of, set off one day. My dad had gone to take a leak, that's the only reason he survived. We knew to never ask or talk about it. We couldn't slam doors bc it made him jump out of his skin & my mom would spank us & send us to our room. He was an alcoholic but not a mean one. He never slept either. People don't understand how much damage war does not only physically but mentally. All this immigrant racism shit pisses me off too, bc my dad & his buddies were all hispanic, & volunteered to go, even though they had little children at home. I was born in '66. He came home when I was like 5. I remember being afraid of him bc I didn't know him. Thank you for what you are doing. \u270a\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8When you thank a veteran, do it for me, too.",
