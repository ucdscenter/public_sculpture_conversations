One of my favorite things to do in DC is walk around the monuments at night. The lights are different, the crowds are different, and that changes everything. They’re beautiful in the sunshine but even more beautiful in the full moonlight. * 
It’s amazing how small changes are everything. Like realizing how your body has slowly been regulating with quality supplements and conscious eating. *
Perspective is everything too. Glass half full, positive mindset, and moonlit monuments. And bonus: it’s all FREE! *
