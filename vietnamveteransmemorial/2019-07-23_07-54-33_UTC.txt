#DC is amazing, albeit hot and sticky. We visited many landmarks as well as seeing my dad’s cousin’s name, Rudolph Steven Galeana, as well as his friend, Rocky Lee Blair, on the Vietnam Wall. So thankful my dad made it #home❤️💙 #WorldWarIIMemorial #ReflectingPool #WashingtonMemorial #LincolnMemorial #VietnamVeteransMemorial #WhiteHouse #NaturalHistoryMuseum #ArandaTrip
