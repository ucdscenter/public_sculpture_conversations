♤May 19, 1969♤
"Hamburger Hill"
A Screaming Eagle of the 101st Airborne Division attempts to save the life of a buddy at Dong Ap Bia Mountain, near the A Shau Valley. This man was seriously wounded in the last of repeated attempts by U.S. forces to capture enemy positions there. A truly sad series of battles, US troops braving enemy fire and taking terrible casualties to reach the top of a hill they would not hold. However, the Vietnamese holding these positions paid dearly for their defense.
