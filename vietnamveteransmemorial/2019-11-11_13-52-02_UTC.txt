Veterans Day is a tough day for me. I have nothing gushy to post. This is what I think of when I see Veterans Day. These men have recently died or are in their last days because of Agent Orange. I’m heavily involved with the Families of Agent Orange group of 5k and growing. American males have an 80 percent chance of reaching their 70th bday. Only 31 percent of Vietnam Vets reach their 70th bday. None of these men in the pictures have or are receiving Agent Orange compensation. None. Think about this. Happy Veterans Day. *
