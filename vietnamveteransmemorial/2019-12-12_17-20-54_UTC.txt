I spent  Saturday (12/7) in DC visiting monuments and memorials - including the WWII Memorial on what was Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day. I am always overwhelmed with the sense of sacrifice and honor when I visit these locations. #DC #WashingtonDC #WWIIMemorial #PearlHarborRemembranceDay #WashingtonMemorial #LincolnMemorial #VietnamVeteransMemorial
