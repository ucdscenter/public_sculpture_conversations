Every name represents a life cut short and a family changed forever // On January 31, 1968 â€” during the Tet Offensive, American troops experience the deadliest day of the Vietnam War. 246 service members were declared dead or missing in action. The deaths from that day stretch from Panel 35 East, Line 84 to Panel 36 East, Line 44 on The Wall. Join us in remembering their sacrifices today. You can learn about each of them by visiting our Wall of Faces: vvmf.org/thewall
