Well I said it back when we donated this complete repaint of the Vietnam Memorial Chopper that we didn’t do it for the recognition.  We had some really cool vendors that jumped on board and donated pickup/takedown, delivery, paint, decals, and materials.  It was a super fun project and the absolute very least we could do to honor our Vietnam Veterans.  I mean that whole heartedly.  But WOW am I taken back by this special token of appreciation that was given to me today.  I’m honored.... Truly honored to except it!  I will cherish it greatly.  Thank you.
