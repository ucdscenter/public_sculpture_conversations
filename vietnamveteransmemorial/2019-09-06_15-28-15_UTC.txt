The names of those who remain missing and unaccounted for are inscribed on The Wall, too. The remains of more than 1,500 service members have yet to be recovered and returned to their families. A âž• symbol is placed next to their name to denote that they are missing. When their remains are identified and repatriated, a diamond is superimposed over the cross symbol. In two weeks on Friday, Sept. 20, a nation will commemorate National POW/MIA Recognition Day. On that evening at 7 p.m. we will honor those who remain missing and unaccounted for, as well as their families with a candlelight remembrance. (ðŸ“¸: @photolope)
