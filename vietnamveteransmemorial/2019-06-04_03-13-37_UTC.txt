It was announced that 2019 would be the last year for the Annual Rolling Thunder, Memorial Day cross-country biker rally to DC.  The event is being discontinued due to escalating costs, issues with Capital police and other security and other factors.  Still, I imagine that some biker clubs in the Northeast will continue to make the annual visit.  We will miss that massive rumble of automobiles.  Walking back to the Foggy Bottom Metro (that was a painful walk in the heat!), I saw a different sort of rolling thunder: tattooed and patch-laden attired veterans in wheelchairs. #rollingthunder2019 #vietnamveteransmemorial
