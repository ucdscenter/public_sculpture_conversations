This is why I came to DC today. This is my cousin, Lauri Kangro. I never got to meet him because he was killled in action in Vietnam. I hope his soul was there to greet his mother when she passed away last month. RIP SFC Lauri Kangro and thank you for your service, cousin. #Veteran #VietnamWar #WashingtonDC #DistricOfColumbia #War #Valor #Service #ThankYou #InstaGood #Gratitude #VietnamVeteransMemorial
