LONGFORM: Maya Lin and the NEA ⭐️ Watch the full 📺 on Daily Plinth ⭐️ Link in Bio - Follow us for daily art world videos! ⭐️ Tomorrow, multihyphenate artist-designer-architect Maya Lin turns 60 years old, born on October 5, 1959. It is now nearly impossible to fathom that in 1981 Maya Lin was 21 years old and still an undergraduate student at Yale when she won the commission for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington DC, administered by the National Endowment for the Arts.⠀
⠀
On the occasion of the NEA’s 50th Anniversary in 2015, the agency produced this video tracing its long history of support for Lin and her projects.⠀
