The day after #Christmas, we took the kids to #WashingtonDC. We had such an amazing time staying in #Georgetown. We went #iceskating, we got to see #Enchant at #NationalsPark, went to the #AirandSpaceMuseum, #NaturalHistoryMuseum, #AmericanHistoryMuseum, bowling at #Pinstripes, dodged the rain and went to the movies, and visited the #LincolnMemorial, #WashingtonMemorial, #CapitalBuilding, #WhiteHouse, #VietnamVeteransMemorial, #WorldWarIIMemorial.  The kids enjoyed the colder weather and we made some great memories!
