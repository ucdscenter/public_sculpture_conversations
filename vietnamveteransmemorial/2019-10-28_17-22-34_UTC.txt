Reflections Near and Far - 2 of 9: 'In Touch With the Past'⁣
⁣
This photograph is a reflection in several senses, with a young student seeking out a name on the wall of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. ⁣
⁣
We often take photographs for many of the same reasons we build memorials--to remember where we've been, what we've done, and what we've seen. We also use photographs to remind us of what is possible, both good and bad. ⁣
⁣
Despite the somber, quiet nature, I see a lot of hope in this image, and I wonder if you do, too? ⁣
