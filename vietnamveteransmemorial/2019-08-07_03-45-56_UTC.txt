Vietnam War Memorial. The wall lists every enlisted American who died in the war. You can be provided with a slip of paper and pencil and if you have a relative on the wall, you can trace their name onto the paper for a keepsake. The man behind me is in the act of doing so. Sorry for all the pics of memorials. It might seem dorky but I’ve been to DC a few times now and every time I go, I visit them all. I think it’s really cool that my country honors their heroes in such an epic way. I enjoy seeing all the different types of people around and there’s nobody arguing about politics or seeing who can be the loudest. Everyone is just taking in the spectacle. It’s easy to make fun of ‘Merica and it’s flaws but I find genuine pride in showing all this off to my kids.
