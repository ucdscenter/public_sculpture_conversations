Today we went out to help place flags on the Veterans graves in preparation for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Moving Wall coming to Queen of Heaven cemetery starting tomorrow. Over 100,000 people are expected to attend this event over the next four days. I am so honored that our Scouts were asked to be a part of this. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ #vietnamveterans #vietnamveteransmemorial #cubscoutsofamerica #cubscouts #cubscoutmom #boyscouts #boyscoutsofamerica #bsa #scouting #america #godblessamerica #myboy #myson #boymom #boymomlife
