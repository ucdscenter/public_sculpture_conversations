For Veterans Day, a true story - ⁣
⁣⁣
⁣My old man was KIA in ‘Nam in 1968. That’s him in the first pic. Last year on Memorial Day (the 50th anniversary of his death) I ride down to the memorial in DC to pay my respects. There’s some biker rally there but in the midst of the chaos who do I see? Bob Salo and the guys from dad’s platoon - the @720th_mp_bn . They’re there to lay a wreath by dad’s name. ⁣

⁣An emotional, impromptu reunion with some old friends ensued.  Most of the guys were kids when dad was killed and I think it meant something to them to know that I’m here. For me, I don’t have the words to convey what it meant to know my family’s loss wasn’t forgotten by those that served with dad.⁣

⁣To all our vets, thank you. ⁣
