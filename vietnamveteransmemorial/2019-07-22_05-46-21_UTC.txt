Another incredibly moving tribute, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC. Again, this wasnâ€™t my first visit but it takes the breath away each time. Seeing a group of fellows in their (I think) late teens visiting, I thought how closely their ages must be to many of those whose lives ended far too soon in war.
