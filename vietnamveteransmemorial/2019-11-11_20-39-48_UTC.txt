I represented Hero Dogs at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC today. It was an honor and privilege to meet so many veterans, hear their stories, and thank them for their service. As a Hero Dogs puppy in training, my goal is to give a veteran or first responder with a disability a life of independence.
