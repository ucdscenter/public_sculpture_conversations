For many kids going back to school, the year is another golden opportunity to better understand history // The Vietnam War is one of the most divisive moments in US history. Because of this, it can be difficult to teach younger generations about its impact.  Visiting the memorial is one way kids have the opportunity to learn about veterans who served and sacrificed, learn personal stories, commemorate local heroes, and understand healing through memorials. A wide array of education materials and tools, lessons and readings are available to help connect kids with the men and women who gave all for our country. Educating about the lasting impact of war is an essential part of our mission. Visit vvmf.org/teaching-the-vietnam-era to find new ways to explain the Vietnam War and era to our smallest learners 🧒🚸👧🙋🏽‍♀️
