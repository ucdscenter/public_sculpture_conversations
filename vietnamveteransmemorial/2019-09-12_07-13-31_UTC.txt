For our #WomenCrushWednesday, we are featuring designer, Maya Lin!  You may have seen her work at the Vietnam Veteran’s Memorial where she was awarded first place for her design while training at Yale University. Check out her Stones collection as it reflects her keen sense of simple, elegant beauty with clear inspirations of nature. Used as either stools or side tables, the stones are a colorful addition to the office, playroom or patio. ⁠
