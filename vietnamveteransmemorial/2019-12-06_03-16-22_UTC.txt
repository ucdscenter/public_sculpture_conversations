The Vietnam Veterans Memorial is one of the most emotional monuments in Washington.  So many names, it’s hard to believe they all perished in the same war. Makes it even harder to comprehend the hundreds of thousands of Americans who died in the previous wars.  The crosses by the names represent Americans whose bodies were never recovered.  What those families must have gone through. 
War sucks. Regardless of its necessity, it has been a part of human history from the beginning.  Who knows if we’ll ever find a way to avoid it. But thank God for the men and women who chose to give a chunk of their lives to the service of this great country.  And special gratitude to those who sacrificed everything and the families  they left behind.
