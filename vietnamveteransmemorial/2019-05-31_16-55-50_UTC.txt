This past Memorial Day was such a rainy day, and I mostly stayed indoors. I contemplated the many men and women who have died for this country I call home. I also thought about what they have fought for. And sometimes it seems like their sacrifice was so small...because of the many problems we face in our country; such as poverty, hunger, and greed. As I look back on my visit to the Vietnam Memorial in D.C. I see how far we have come as a country, and yet how far we have to go. Our freedoms are forever something I am thankful for, but I am not entitled to these freedoms simply because I was privileged enough to be born here. I am not the only one worthy of having these freedoms just because I am a U.S. citizen. Iâ€™d like to believe those who have fought for our freedoms, are doing so in order to create a better world for all human kind. Otherwise, what is the purpose of war?
