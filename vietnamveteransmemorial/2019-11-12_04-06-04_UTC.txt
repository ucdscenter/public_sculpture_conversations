It's hard to believe he's an old man; I also watched his hair change color like Autumn leaves.
Born of a generation seeking to live forever young, he depises the notion.
For my 'ole man,' getting old sucks. 
Ask anyone who knows my dad and they'll tell you he's as mature as the afternoon, and they can't believe he's still alive.
But even malaria can't keep him down longer than a weekend, and it tried.
He saw The Doors play at the Whiskey, watched Alice Cooper get boo'ed offstage at the Cheetah in Santa Monica, and witnessed Jimi Hendrix light his guitar on fire at the Monterey Pop Festival, all before he got drafted in 1968.  He missed out on Woodstock because of a tour of duty in Southeast Asia, but he surfed Vung Tau.  Over there, a mosquito introduced him to malaria, they dated for three days.
Veteran of a foreign war, he earned his Combat Infantryman Badge the ole fashion way when he got shot at for the first time.  Entering the Republic of Vietnam as a private and rifleman, he left as an E-6 staff sergeant and platoon leader.
Never without his moxy, this aging young man knows how to have a better time than you loaded or sober.  He dealt with more shit than a septic tank in 1969 fighting ground warfare through infantry combat, and lived to forget about it...surviving was enough.
Veteran's Day is a celebration to honor those who served and those who survived, the ones who lived to talk about those we mourn on Memorial Day.
