2ndLt Duncan Sleigh sacrificed his life shielding another wounded Marine awaiting medevac. He was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross. I first heard Lt Sleigh’s story at The Wall in DC from Marines who served with him. Hearing about him while picking out his name from over 58,000 on the wall made the retelling of his service a truly powerful experience. Semper Fi Lt Sleigh.

As the company pressed the attack, the wounded and dead were moved toward the rear where Second Lieutenant Sleigh was directing the establishment of a landing zone. Taking charge of the critical situation, Second Lieutenant Sleigh strategically deployed his men to return suppressive fire and at the same time maintained control of the evacuation. Two helicopter landings were attempted, and on the second effort a rocket propelled grenade landed near the wounded who were being treated. Observing the danger to the wounded, Second Lieutenant Sleigh crawled to one casualty and lay huddled over him as a shield when another rocket propelled grenade landed less than a meter away, instantly killing Second Lieutenant Sleigh. He thus absorbed most of the shock with his body, not only saving the life of one Marine, but also preventing injury to others near him. His valiant leadership and courageous fighting spirit inspired all the men of the company who observed his last brave act...”
