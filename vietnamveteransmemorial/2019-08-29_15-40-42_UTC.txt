Our carpenters take pride in every volunteer project they are involved in, but with projects like these, we know they go the extra mile. Itâ€™s our respect for all veterans, who served our nation; Americaâ€™s heroes.
ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
Yesterday, dozens of Carpenters #Local290 donated their time and skills to help set up The Vietnam Veterans Memorial "Wall That Heals" which stands at Eisenhower Park in East Meadow on Long Island.
ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
The Wall is as a symbol of America's honor and recognition of the men and women who served and sacrificed their lives in the Vietnam War and a way of paying tribute to our nationâ€™s Vietnam veterans and their families.
ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
We would like to thank our Local 290 18 apprentices, Long Island Training Center Instructors, John Ardolino and John Jerosh, Training Coordinator, Mark West and our retirees Phil DeCaneo (former Instructor and Vietnam veteran) and Bill Macchione (former Director of Training and Vietnam veteran) for their volunteerism, hard work and for always helping to make a positive impact in the veterans community.
