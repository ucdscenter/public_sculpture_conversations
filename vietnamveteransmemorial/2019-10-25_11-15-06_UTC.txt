Trail Life Troop PA-2215 had the unforgettable experience of visiting #TheWallThatHeals, a Mobile #VietnamVeteransMemorial memorializing more than 58,000 service members who paid the ultimate price to defend our freedom. Three days after their visit, the Troop had the privilege of helping to disassemble the wall. Trailmen were impacted by the level of honor and respect paid to the men and women whose names appeared on the wall even during the disassembling and storing process. #TrailLifeUSA #WalkWorthy
