Posted @phillydesign.win Posted @withrepost • @princetonu_artmuseum Join us this Tuesday 11/5 at 5pm to hear Maya Lin in conversation with Museum Director James Steward.

Marking the completion of two new signature works of public art at Princeton by the world-renowned artist Maya Lin, this informal discussion will focus on public art, design inspiration, and the relationship in Lin’s practice between art, architecture, and design. The two new major commissions are The Princeton Line, an undulating sculpted line of molded earth that travels a steep slope, and Einstein’s Table, a granite “water table,” both important additions to the University’s public art collection, which is already deemed to be among the finest in the nation.

This event is free and open to the public and take place on stage in Richardson Auditorium. Reserve tickets through tickets.princeton.edu or call 609-258-9220. Tickets will also be available at the door until 4:50 pm and while supplies last. A reception in the Museum will follow.
