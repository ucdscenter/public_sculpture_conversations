Spotted this fabulous monument for our Vietnam Veterans at the York State Fair. It's no surprise to see the names of patriotic construction companies on those plates. Many Vietnam vets that were disrespected upon returning from the war tell stories of healing after seeing so many American flags waving over construction sites. Donating time, money, or materials to a project like this is a powerful and worthwhile marketing endeavor. But don't do it as a marketing ploy. Make it a genuine tribute to those that served. #vietnamveterans #vietnamveteransmemorial #vietnamvets #vietnamvetsmemorial #yorkstatefair #constructionmarketing
