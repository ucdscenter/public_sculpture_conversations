Just finished reading an excellent overview of the Vietnam War told through personal stories: Boots on the Ground by Elizabeth Partridge (available in the library!) And today happens to be the anniversary of the dedication of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Highly recommend the book and honoring the Veterans. #vietnamveteransmemorial #bootsontheground #elizabethpartridge #recommendedreading #highschoollibrary #librariansofWAstate
