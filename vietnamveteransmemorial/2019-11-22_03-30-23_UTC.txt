The Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall provides one of the National Mall’s most powerful scenes. In truth, the serene granite “wall” is actually made up of two identical walls that each stretch 246 feet and 9 inches, containing over 58,320 names. The names are listed in chronological order based on the date of casualty, and within each day, names are shown in alphabetical order.

Perhaps, the memorial wall’s most defining characteristic is a visitor’s ability to see his or her reflection at the same time as the engraved names, connecting them to the past and the present.
