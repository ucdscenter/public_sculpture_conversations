Hello, everyone. ðŸ‘‹ For those who may be new to following us or who have followed us for a while - we want to share a little about ourselves and what we do. We are the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund (VVMF) -Â  the nonprofit organization that built The Wall in 1982 â€“ with no government funding. Our mission is to honor and preserve the legacy of service in America and educate about the impact of the Vietnam War. Every day we work to honor those who served and sacrificed, preserve The Wall and the legacies of those inscribed on it, and educate current and future generations. We have a partnership with the National Park Service for long-term care and maintenance of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial site. But it's through donations from our generous supporters that we can: add names/make status changes on The Wall when necessary; hold ceremonies on Memorial Day and Veterans Day; provide free name rubbings to the public; have a Preservation Specialist come out 4-5 times a year to care for the Three Servicemen Statue and In Memory plaque. We pride ourselves on keeping the site in exceptional shape for our visitors. Donations to VVMF go to the care/preservation of the site as well as our many programs including: The Wall That Heals mobile exhibit that travels the country, the In Memory program that honors Vietnam veterans who died after returning home, finding photos for our online Wall of Faces, and all of our educational efforts.Â Today is #GivingTuesday and you can help support our mission! Today, any donation you make will be TRIPLED. To learn more or donate, click the link in our bio! .
