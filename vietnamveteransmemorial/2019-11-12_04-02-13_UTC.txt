It was a privilege and an honor to represent Hero Dogs and greet so many veterans and their loved ones at the #vietnamveteransmemorial @nationalparkservice today. Usually when I am wearing my vest, being petted is not allowed but on an occasion like this my raisers said it was okay. #iwouldmakeanamazingtherapydog #herodogsinc #servicedogsforamericasheroes #servicedogintraining #goldenretriever #goldenretrieversofinstagram
