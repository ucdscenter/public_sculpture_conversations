Brian Murphy is a Vietnam Veterans Memorial Volunteer. His connection to this sacred place is personal. The name of his older brother, Dick Murphy, is inscribed on Panel 57W, Line 29 of The Wall. He died on June 15, 1968 when he was shot by an enemy sniper.

BrianÂ became a Vietnam Veterans Memorial Volunteer in 2015. He travels down to the nationâ€™s capital a handful number of times a year with his sister, Maureen. Brian always leaves a tethered flag and a photo collage of Dick and his comrades at his panel. Dick brought a small American flag everywhere he went in Vietnam and when he died, it was returned to the family with the signatures of 21 of his comrades.

Brian is the 2019 recipient of VVMFâ€™s Libby Hatch Award, which recognizes a volunteer for their outstanding commitment and tireless effort in preserving the legacy of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. Thank you, Brian! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡²
