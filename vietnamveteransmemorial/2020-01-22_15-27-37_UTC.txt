Half of the panels on The Wall include names of those who died in 1968, the deadliest year of the Vietnam War. Amongst the major engagements of that year, the siege of Khe Sanh, the battle of Hue, and the Tet Offensive were amongst the bloodiest of the war.Â The Battle of Khe Sanh began on January 21, 1968. Khe Sanh was the site of a U.S. Marine outpost. Situated in a valley, the outpost came under attack from North Vietnamese forces and was cut off. The siege would last until April and 205 Americans would lose their lives related to the battle, according to official Marine Corps histories. General agreement is that the attack on Khe Sanh was seen as a diversion to the major offensive launched by the North Vietnamese nine days later on the first day of the new year celebration - also known as Tet.
