#RememberTheFallen....Posted @withrepost â€¢ @vnveteransmemorial This week we will be sharing the stories of dads on The Wall and the dads we lost too soon as we approach #FathersDay. Thousands of sons and daughters lost a dad in the Vietnam War. We will be sharing how their sons and daughters have endured a lifelong journey to healing and how they are honoring their life and legacy. We will also remember the dads who succumbed to illnesses and dieases related to their exposure to Agent Orange and suicide as a result of PTSD. The week will conclude with the #FathersDay Rose Remembrance at The Wall on Sunday, June 16. See tributes that have been left for dads in year's past. .
