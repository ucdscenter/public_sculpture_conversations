VIETNAM MEMORIAL STATUE #facts: 
The Vietnam Women’s Memorial statue was unveiled on Veterans Day of 1993.
Former Army nurse Diane Carlson Evans led the efforts to recognize the bravery of the nearly 11,000 women who volunteered.
Evans was the first woman in U.S. history to lead an initiative to create a national monument in D.C.
Artist Glenna Goodacre composed a scene of a “moment in crisis” to capture the range of emotions women faced in fulfilling their duties.
The bandage on the wounded soldier’s face is meant to help visitors see themselves as him, and connect with the comfort and care women provided. #vietnam #veteran #vietnamveteransmemorial #army
