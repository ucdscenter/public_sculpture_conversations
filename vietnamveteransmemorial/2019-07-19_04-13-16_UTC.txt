Washington D.C. part 3▪️ There were many monuments & buildings that we just kinda paused at & checked off the list. Then, there were these. The exhibits that made us stop in our tracks, wipe the tears from our eyes, explain to the kids why we were sad, & vow to each other to {continue to} do our part to raise empathetic & kind humans who stand up for themselves AND others, even when it’s not easy.▪️We chose not to go on a tour of the White House until the current occupant vacates, & we decided to spend that time in the National Museum of African American Heritage & Culture, instead. We only visited the lowest level & toured the History Galleries. It was deeply disturbing. I simply cannot, & will never be able to, wrap my brain around slavery & racism. Of course, I knew that going in, but to see everything in one place, to know how far we came up to the point of Obama & then were set back under Trump, to know that “freedom ISN’T free” & was built on the backs of slaves, & to see the faces, hear the voices, & read the stories of African Americans who carried us this far was just so much more emotional than I prepared myself for ahead of time.  #nmaahc #smithsonian #koreanwarmemorial #vietnamveteransmemorial #vietnamwomensmemorial #mlkjrmemorial
