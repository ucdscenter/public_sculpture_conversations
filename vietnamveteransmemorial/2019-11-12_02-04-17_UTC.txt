Thank you to all of our #veterans out there for answering the call and keeping us safe and free. A special shout out to my dad @philauram for his service during the Vietnam War. He was there from 1970-71 and celebrated his 21st birthday in a war zone. We’ve made it a tradition to walk the Wall on Veterans Day and etch some of dad’s childhood buddies from Oklahoma that didn’t make it home. Our #VietnamVeterans did not get the welcome home they deserved 50 years ago, but seeing the veterans and even young kids come up to say “welcome home” to dad always chokes me up. Better late than never. And a huge shout out to my friends @crmorris84 and @cavalewis for sharing in @philauram’s experience today and for always going out of your way to respect our veterans. It means so much to them. #washingtondc #veteransday2019 #vietnamveteransmemorial #veteran #USA
