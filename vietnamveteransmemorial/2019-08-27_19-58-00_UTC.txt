The Wall represents a cut or gash in the earth that appears to reveal a wound that was Vietnam and our loss. The design is unique. It is made of black granite while everything else on the National Mall is white. It is simplistic, making the names its central focus. In its entirety, The Wall is long - coming to 493 ft. The east and west walls of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial are 246 feet, 8 inches long and point outwards to the northeast corners of the Washington Monument and Lincoln Memorial. The walls are supported by 140 panels. At the apex, the walls are 10 feet, 1.5 inches high. It's a living memorial and the only place where visitors leave offerings and tributes - such as letters, stuffed animals, and photos to connect with the dead.
