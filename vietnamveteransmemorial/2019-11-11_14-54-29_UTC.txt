The dark surface of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial reflects winter trees and the Washington Monument as a vibrant sunset fills the sky over Washington D.C.⁠
⁠
Remembrance Day in Canada is an observance of Armistice Day and the end of World War I, and November 11th is also Veterans Day in the United States, honoring living veterans.⁠
⁠
This image was made during my first visit to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on a bitterly cold January evening many years ago. I was not prepared for the scale of the wall; the descent along the polished black surface, the towering lists of names one column of small lettering after another. I remember the colour shifting in the sky as the sunset deepened towards dusk, and I tried to wrap my mind around the magnitude of a conflict that until this moment had seemed to be just another chapter in my history textbook, another distant and terrible conflict.⁠
⁠
Both those that volunteered and those that were drafted are honoured, 58195 names carved in stone. Living, dead, and missing in action.⁠
