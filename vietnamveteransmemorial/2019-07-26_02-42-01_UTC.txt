It was always hoped that the Memorial would be accessible to visitors 24 hours a day. For its first two years, volunteer veterans kept a nighttime vigil to light the way for visitors. â€œThis particular image was the very expression of â€˜service.â€™ These individuals [were] protecting The Wall, escorting visitors to it, caring for it with such love, and The Wall was reflecting all of that beauty," J.C. Cummings, the architect of record for The Wall, said. 
Of course, this was not a long-term solution and, in 1984, a lighting system was installed. By 2004, after 20 years, the lighting was updated and became easier to maintain. This enhances the beautiful nighttime experience you see here. (ðŸ“¸: @lisamrounds)
