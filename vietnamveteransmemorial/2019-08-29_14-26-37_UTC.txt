This morning at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial on the National Mall.

Dedicated on 13 November 1984, the memorial is shaped as a V cut into the surrounding park. As you walk down, the granite walls rise to the height of 3 meters. The walls list the names of all 58,272 American soldiers who perished in the war. Paper index books allow visitors to find individual names.

I personally like the memorial’s design: it’s plain, humble, mentions each individual’s sacrifice and makes no political statements.
