Every Fatherâ€™s Day, @vnveteransmemorial lays thousands of roses at the Memorial site. Red roses are laid in honor of those killed in action. Yellow in honor of our POW/MIA. White with pink edges in honor of those that returned home and later died as a result of their service. We were honored to be a part of this beautiful tribute.
