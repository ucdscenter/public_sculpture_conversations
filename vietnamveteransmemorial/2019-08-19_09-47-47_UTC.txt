50 years ago today...August 19, 1969. Our Love, Honor and Respect shines as bright today, as it did back then, and will continue for years to come. 
Cpl. Dennis F. Shine Jr. was a son, brother, husband, father, uncle, cousin and friend. He is our American Hero. ❤️🇺🇸💙 #honorthefallen #dad #goldstarfamily #vietnam #neverforget #proudfamily #ourhero #army #101stairborne #vietnamveteransmemorial
