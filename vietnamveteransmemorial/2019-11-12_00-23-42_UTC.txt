To all the Americans who served and fought for our country, thank you from the bottom of my heart. I cannot express in words how grateful I am for your service. For the rest of us, take a second to recognize the sacrifices of our veterans and thank them for their service. 
Looking at the Vietnam Veterans Memorial is painful. Each name inscribed in stone is a serviceman or woman who lost their lives in the conflict. The memorial stretches for 2 acres. 
Never forget the sacrifices of our veterans.
