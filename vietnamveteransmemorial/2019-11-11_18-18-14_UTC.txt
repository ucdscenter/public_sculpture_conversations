For #VeteransDay I visited the #vietnamveteransmemorial. I saw many vets who served in Vietnam. They carried their gear in-country but brought back their experiences, carrying that weight for decades. They carried it as they walked past the wall, seeing their friends and fellow soldiers, dead & alive. As one vet told me, “There are two kinds of people—those who have opinions about the war and those who were there.” Needless to say I also saw camaraderie and togetherness, repeatedly hearing “Welcome home.” 🇺🇸
