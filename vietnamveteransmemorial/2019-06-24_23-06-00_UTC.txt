Every morning I wake up and see these words my father wrote to me, carved from wood by @aliwoodcreations so I can feel them. Tomorrow would have been my dad’s 67th birthday; he always used to say, “when you get this old, it’s just another day.” It’s hard to treat it as just another day when it marks the beginning of a life whose ending broke me. I hope I am doing my father’s legacy justice. #AgentOrangeAwareness #VietnamVeteransDaughter #VietnamVeteransMemorial #HappyBirthdayDad
