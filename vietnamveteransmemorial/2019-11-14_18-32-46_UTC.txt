The Vietnam Veterans Memorial - The Wall - This was the most somber, moving experience of our entire trip! This place evokes great emotion. More than Arlington. More than the WWII Memorial. More than any of them. We cried. You could feel something special here. I’m not sure how the creators of the Wall were able to accomplish this...maybe it’s actually seeing all of the names...I don’t know. I do know that if you ever have the chance to visit this remarkable place, take it. It will stir up sadness, sympathy, appreciation, and pride at the same time. #washingtondc #dc2019 #dc2019Day2 #vietnamveteransmemorial #thewall
