Washington by day and night.

We spent a long time in DC on Thursday. We walked 8 miles and took every major piece of transportation in the city but we saw a lot of neat sites.

Last night we went on a tour of the city that was exclusively for guests of the campground. It was so neat to see DC at night. 
Yesterday was POW/MIA Recognition Day so the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was lit with patriotic candles. It was even more touching to see the wall and names highlighted by the nightâ€™s light.
