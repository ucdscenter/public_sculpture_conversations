Words escape me often. I am math minded and words have always been at a loss for me. Today. Today is the same. I can say ... It will never be easier... I will never be less sad ...I will never miss you less... however every November 17th I will celebrate you and have a “what would dad do” day.  #daddysgirl #agentorangeawareness #vietnamveteransmemorial
