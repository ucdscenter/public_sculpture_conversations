♤May 14, 1967♤
L.Cpl. Robert A. Gazaille of Blackstone, Massachusetts shows the weariness of Marines pursuing the Viet Cong during a search and destroy operation 12 miles south of Da Nang. Temperatures were in the 90’s and the Viet Cong stayed out of the way during this particular day’s action. Gazaille, is a member of Co. C, 1st Bn., First Marine Regiment, 1st Mar Div. A small but noteworthy detail is he has an airborne helmet liner, this can be told by the chinstrap yokes hanging next to his ears. Robert passed away on November 21, 2005 at age 58.
