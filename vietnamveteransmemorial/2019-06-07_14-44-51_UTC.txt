Who is the youngest service member on The Wall? U.S. Marine Corps Pfc. Dan Bullock is a name everyone should know, but many do not. The teen was just 15 years old when he was killed in action in the Quang Nam province of Vietnam on June 7, 1969, making him the youngest American casualty of the Vietnam War. At age 14, he enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps after he doctored his birth certificate. Dan arrived in Vietnam on May 18, 1969.
He was large in stature, but despite his size, he was a boy in every regard.
Nearly one month after being in-country, the 15-year-old was killed as a result of small arms fire while on night watch duty, according to his squad leader. His name is inscribed on Panel 23W, Line 96 of The Wall.
