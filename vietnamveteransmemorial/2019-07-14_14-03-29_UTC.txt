Volunteers young and old offering time, respect, and gratitude ❤️🇺🇸 Families and friends of @militaryfamilyorg washed The Wall today. All washings are coordinated by @nationalmallnps . We are lucky to have a host of individuals and organizations that care about and for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial.
