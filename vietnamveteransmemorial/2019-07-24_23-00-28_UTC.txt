: witnessed a really lovely moment at the @vnveteransmemorial today where a girl on her friends shoulders managed to find the name of her grandfather, she was on FaceTime to her dad so that he could see his fatherâ€™s name on the memorial ðŸ’• #vietnamveteransmemorial #washingtondc #washingtonmonument #washingtonmall
