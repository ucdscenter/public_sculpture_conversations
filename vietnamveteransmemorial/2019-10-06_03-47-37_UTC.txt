”I try to give people a different way of looking at their surroundings. That's art to me.” #designer #architect #artist #mayalin, born #onthisdayinhistory October 25, 1959. Wishing #mayayinglin the happiest of birthdays 🎂 at just 21 years old she designed the #vietnamveteransmemorial while still an undergraduate at Yale. Environmental issues have concerned her since childhood.  She has stated “I'm very much a product of the growing awareness about ecology and the environment al movement...I am very drawn to landscape, and my work is about finding a balance in the landscape, respecting nature not trying to dominate it. Even the Vietnam Veterans Memorial is an earthwork. All of my work is about slipping things in, inserting an order or a structuring, yet making an interface so that in the end, rather than a hierarchy, there is a balance and tension between the man-made and the natural." #womenmakinghistory #womencreatingchange #herstory #womeninarchitecture #5womenartists #femaleartists #americanartists #asianamerican #chineseamerican #rightfullyhers #feministart #intersectionalfeminism #womenwhoinspire
