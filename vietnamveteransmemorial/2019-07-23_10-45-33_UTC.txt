Walked down to Times Square. Wow, huge area, nothing like our Federation Square! Packed with people, lots of hustle and bustle, noise and smells and a hot dog seller every 20 metres or so.
Have learnt that walking estimates (mi) on maps are actually miles and not minutes, oops üôÑ

We took the subway to Wall Street, saw Trinity Church first built in 1698, walked down to The Battery with Vietnam Veterans memorials, 
Saw NY Fire Dept, first respondents to 911, caught a ferry to see Statue of Liberty, (real name Liberty Enlightening the World), Brooklyn Bridge, Manhattan Bridge, Alice Island, Goveners Island with 300 year old cannon still atop the fort, Hudson River and a great skyline of New York City. When cruise was over we walked a bloody long way through China Town, Little Italy where we had lunch and rode on the Subway back where I kept imagining that Subway Ghost (from movie Ghost) would jump through the carriage at any moment üòù
Today, July 22nd, 32 deg, we are heading to Central Park.
