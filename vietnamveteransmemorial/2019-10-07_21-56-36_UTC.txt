I was grateful to visit these places at nightâ€”all lite up. The World War ll memorial is so beautiful. The granite and water made it a peaceful place to remember those who served our country during that time.

The last three pics are the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. It is a granite wall inscribed with the names of the 58,286 Americans missing or killed in the Vietnam War. .
