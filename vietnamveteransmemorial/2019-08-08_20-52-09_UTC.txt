Was not aware we have a Vietnam Veterans Memorial in NYC. 
The youngest American serviceman killed in action was fifteen years old!  He altered his birth certificate to enlist.  The green monument has letters written from soldiers.  Wished I could have captured some of the inscribed letters: very touching.  Thank you for your service and sacrifice! #vietnamveteransmemorial #nyc
