I was honored to stand by @vargamtamas side while we explored our nation’s capital. This is your history now too ❤️🇺🇸💙 Thank you @jessi_kinn and @ckinninger for being gracious and generous hosts. Love you both! This was a humbling experience.  #washingtondc #thepentagon #washingtonmonument #wwiimemorial #vietnamveteransmemorial #lincolnmemorial #koreanwarmemorial #remember #honor #protect #givethanks
