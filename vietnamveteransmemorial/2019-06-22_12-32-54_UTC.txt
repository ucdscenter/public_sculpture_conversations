Care 👐 and preservation are vital to the upkeep of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. One of those ways includes weekly Wall washings 🧽 
NPS organizes and schedules weekly washings of The Wall by groups of volunteers, from April to November when the temperatures are above freezing. The groups consist of student, veterans, and civic and community organizations from a variety of locations. This group from last weekend was a tremendous help! .
