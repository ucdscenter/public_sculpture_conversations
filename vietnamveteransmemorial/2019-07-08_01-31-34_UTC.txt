My #parents and I went to #thewallthatheals traveling #vietnamveteransmemorial - they did an amazing job- it was so much more than I was expecting. It was #emotional and #sobering - seeing so many #veterans there added to that. I pray that a #memorial like it will never be needed again. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ #vietnamveteran #vietnamvet #honor #honorthefallen #flags #americanflags #respect
