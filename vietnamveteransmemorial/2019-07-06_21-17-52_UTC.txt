♤April 26, 1966♤
A sailor mans his M1919 .30 caliber machine gun on a utility boat cruising in the Rung Sat Special Zone during Operation Jackstay. Note he is wearing a WW2 era M1 helmet shell, as indicated by the sewn on chinstraps. Sorry for the long break in between posts, it'll be back to a regular schedule now.
