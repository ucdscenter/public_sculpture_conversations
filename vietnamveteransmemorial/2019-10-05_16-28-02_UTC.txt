Happy birthday, Maya Lin! ðŸŽ‚ ðŸŽˆðŸŽ‰ Maya was 21 years old when she won the design competition for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. She beat out more than 1,400 other entries. Her design, which was unique and untraditional, called for the memorial to made of polished granite. It would appear as a rift in the earth. The walls would be reflective so as to create a sense of personal reflection and private reckoning. She wanted people to be able to see themselves. The Wall would also be black - while everything else in Washington was white. To no surprise, this design caused controversy and uproar. Many derided it and she became a central part of the debate. Her design was called "the black gash of shame." Others didn't like that she was a woman, and some didn't like that she was of Chinese descent. Maya, who was born in Ohio, fought hard and pasionately for her design. She didn't back down, and through talks and debates, and an eventual compromise - she prevailed. Since 1982, her simplistic design has evoked a powerful sense of honor and reflection. She has gone on to have a rewarding and successful career. Maya was born #onthisday in 1959.
