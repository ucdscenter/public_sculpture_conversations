With its polished slabs of black granite etched with the names of 58,000 Americans who died serving in Vietnam, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial is profoundly poignant in its austerity. The Wall becomes reflective in close proximity and beckons visitors to reach out and touch its inscribed names, as this young girl is doing. Gratifying to see younger generations pausing to reflect, honor, and learn about our nationâ€™s history.
