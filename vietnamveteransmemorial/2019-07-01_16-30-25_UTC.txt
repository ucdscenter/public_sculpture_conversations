#Onthisday in 1980 at a ceremony at the White House Rose Garden, President Jimmy Carter signs legislation providing two aces of land near the Lincoln Memorial for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. The signing of the bill comes after the insurmountable work of garnering support and approval in the House and Senate. It also comes after the creation of the nonprofit, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund. In the fall of 1980, a design competition would be held. Maya Lin, a 21-year-old student at Yale, would deliver the winning design. Her design had the two acre site consisting of a v-shaped memorial that would list the names of the men and women who did in the war. The memorial site would be a park within a park, harmonious with its surroundings. In 1982, The Wall was dedicated. Today, the two acre site reflects that peaceful nature, attracting approximately five million visitors a year. .
