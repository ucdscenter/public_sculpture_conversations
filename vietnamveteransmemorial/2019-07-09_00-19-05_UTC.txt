On July 8, 1959 - 60 years ago -  there was an attack on a compound in Bien Hoa, 20 miles northeast of Saigon, where the first two Americans were killed by enemy fire in Vietnam. They died while they were watching a movie. The two men were Major Dale R. Buis and Master Sergeant Chester M. Ovnand. Both were U.S. advisors who offered military aid and helped train South Vietnamese forces. They are the first names inscribed on The Wall. Chester Ovnand's name is inscribed twice. First on Panel 1E where it is spelled incorrectly. It is re-inscribed on Panel 7E, Line 46.
