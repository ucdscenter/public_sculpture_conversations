The Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. was dedicated on November 13, 1982 to honor the service members who had lost their lives during this controversial war. A site near the Lincoln Memorial was chosen and authorized by Congress and a design competition was announced. Maya Lin, a 21-year-old architecture student at Yale, won the blind competition. The artist and her minimalist design drew criticism: some detractors protested her Asian heritage, while others disliked the idea of the black granite monument with no ornamentation. Lin’s idea was to create a symbolic open wound in the earth to replicate the grief over those who were lost. The finished memorial proved to be an immersive experience, as the names of the dead rise higher and higher the closer the visitor gets to the center of the memorial; at the same time, the shiny granite acts like a mirror, reflecting the faces of the living. This powerful combination, as well as the 58,320 names chiseled into the granite, inspired pilgrimages by Vietnam veterans and their families. Thousands of objects, including flowers, notes, dog tags, army boots, and other memorabilia have been left in tribute at what has come to be known fondly as “the wall.” *
