Today I was mysteriously drawn to the ceremony at the Vietnam Veteranâ€™s Memorial for all Vets but particularly those who served in Vietnam. Vietnam - the war that introduced me to war. The one I protested, the one I watched nightly on TV, the one that affected my then, innocent view of the world. I watched, I listened, I felt guilty about my conflicted take on war in general. I stayed long after people left. The isolation and aloneness of this bench made me sigh. #veteransday #vietnamveteransmemorial #veterans #war
