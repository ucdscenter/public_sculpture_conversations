Reggie and I were in the vicinity of the Durham County Vietnam Veterans Living Memorial today. We went to pay respects to the Durham County KIA, MIA, and Survivors who served in Vietnam. There is also a War Dog Memorial where Reggie could pay respect to his brothers. Of roughly 4000 dogs that served in Vietnam only about 200 made it home. MWDs that survived were mostly left in country when handlers rotated home. Thanks to all who served. God bless America. ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ #vietnamwarmemorial #durhamcounty #vietnamveterans #vietnamveteransmemorial #powmia #mwd #wardogs #vietnamwardogs #k9 #k9unit #bombdog #k9storminc #workingdogsofinstagram #workingdogs
