#vietnamveteransmemorial THE ORGANIZATION OF THE WALL FACTS: 
The two 200-feet-long walls contain more than 58,000 names.
The names are listed in chronological order by date of their casualty and begin and end at the origin point, or center, of the memorial where the two walls meet.
Having the names begin and end at the center is meant to form a circle â€“ a completion to the war.
By including the names of all those who were killed or missing in action, the memorial conveys just how overwhelming the casualties were during this war.
Visitors can see a reflection of themselves in the names on the black granite walls, connecting the living to those lost. #vietnam #veterans #army #marines #navy #airforce #usa #nationalguard #coastguard #usmc
