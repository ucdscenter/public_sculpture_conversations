Smithsonian photographers, including Jeff Tinsley, Richard K. Hofmeister, Jeff Ploskonka, and Dane Penland, spent the next two years documenting the memorial. In 1986, their works were featured in ‚ÄúVietnam Veterans Memorial: A National Experience,‚Äù an exhibit which included 70 black and white photos by Smithsonian photographers and made its way throughout the United States with @sitesexhibitions. ‚Å†‚†Ä

Additionally, in 1992, @amhistorymuseum opened an exhibit, titled ‚ÄúPersonal Legacy: The Healing of a Nation,‚Äù which highlighted a few of the 30,000 momentos that had been left at the memorial. ‚Å†‚†Ä
