The mobile Vietnam Veteran Memorial Wall... A perfect way to celebrate the 4th at the candlelight service with my Dad.  So many emotions... Special thanks to my Dad for his service, to my family members and in-laws who served, friends who have served and are still serving, and to all that gave their all serving as well as those that serve currently.  Thanks for your service! ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ @mojitojeep #america #vietnam #vietnamveterans #vietnamveteransmemorial #vietnam6869 #0311 #semperfi #marinecorps #marines #marinescorps #usmarine #usmarinescorps #marinedad #merica #supportourveterans #supportourtroops #supportourtroopsandveterans #freedom #fourthofjuly #4thofjuly
