We would like to wish Judy Gorman King a safe trip as she travels to #Vietnam this week. Judy wrote the #lyrics to “The Wall Song”, in collaboration with the singer/songwriter duo Brad Dunse & Mitch Townley. Their beautiful, moving #tribute to the Wall and all the #servicemen and women whose names are engraved on it is featured in “The Wall’s Embrace”. Bon voyage, Judy!
