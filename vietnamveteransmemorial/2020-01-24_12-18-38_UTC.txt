Can't make it to Washington, D.C. to see the Vietnam Veterans Memorial? See us on the road in 2020 as our mobile exhibit travels the country! See #TheWallThatHeals - a three-quarter scale Wall replica and mobile Education Center that will be making its way to 35 communities across America. Honor the more than 58,000 who sacrificed during the war, see digital displays of hometown heroes and veterans in our In Memory program, and see items representative of those left at The Wall. • Garland, Texas February 27 – March 1
