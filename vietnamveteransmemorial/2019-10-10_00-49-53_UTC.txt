Spent an emotional day with the Wall. From 9am when this was just a frame. To 2pm when a man was taking an etching for a friend of his son. To 8:30 pm when the son of a man on the wall was visiting the memorial. Take a minute to go see the Wall That Heals at Mack Park. Cry a little. Hug a stranger. Say a prayer. @vnveteransmemorial #thewallthatheals #vietnamveteransmemorial
