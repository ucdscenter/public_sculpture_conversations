standing tall. this is the vietnam veterans memorial. this is an important marker of a tragic war. here demonstrates the young american lives that were lost in the name of greed and fear of their own country. but let us NEVER forget the names which are not listed. all of the Vietnamese women, children, men, and living creatures that stood sacrifice to this war. their names are not listed here yet their lives were taken. a home invaded, displaced, and destroyed by those who did not call it home. an internal struggle magnified by external forces which were not asked for. 
what is known to be one of the most controversial, unknown, and most confusing wars. mystery clouding itâ€™s history. i ask as a people we not jump to conclusions, to question our governments, to demand answers, to fight for what is right and stop what is wrong.
remember. let us never repeat. 
PBS created a 10part documentary series based on this war documenting the full story with unbiased truths and facts. written by Geoffrey C. Ward and directed by Ken Burns and Lynn Novick. this is an amazing educational piece. I highly recommend it to gain better ground in the sad history that is the Vietnam war
