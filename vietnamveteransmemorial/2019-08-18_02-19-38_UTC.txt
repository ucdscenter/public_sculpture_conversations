Do you have a Vietnam Vet in your family or community? Today 54 years ago my old man ( Tony pictured here) was junior duty officer in the control room of Australian Taskforce HQ Nui Dat (Vietnam) , when all hell broke loose. At a rubber plantation nearby an Australian infantry company had been ambushed and pinned down by a much larger force of Vietnamese soldiers. The next 24 hours saw a fierce and horrific battle that has come to be commemorated as the ‘Battle of Long Tan’’. Dad doesn’t talk about it all much. Today around #australia commemoration services remember the tragic loss of life and sacrifice at such conflicts by holding ‘Vietnam Veterans Memorial Day’. #vietnamwar #vietnamveteransmemorial Growing up in a Vietnam Vet family I am aware of the physical and emotional scars many vets carry with them. Vietnam Vets have also in many ways been shunned by the #ANZAC tradition. Today is a day for families to come together just for them. If you are interested in all this, an Australian film just released ‘Danger Close: The Battle of Long Tan’ tells the vets personal stories. It’s now at many local cinemas. I’ve seen this film and recommend it, it doesn’t glorify war - quite the opposite in fact( IMO) and may just be what is needed to tell their story and give Vietnam Vets the respected role in our national narrative they deserve.
