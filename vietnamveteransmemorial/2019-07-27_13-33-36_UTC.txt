Emilys joined other DC daughters and the National Park Service cleaning and washing the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Wall this morning. We are so fortunate to be DC daughters and participate in these special service projects. #dcdar1776 #dcdar #emilynelsondar #emilynelsondcdar #washingtondc #vietnamveteransmemorial #vietnamveteransmemorial #vietnamwall #servicetoamerica #nationalparkservice #todaysdar #daughtersoftheamericanrevolution
