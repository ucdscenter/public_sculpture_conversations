Cloud Gate is a 110-ton elliptical sculpture forged of a seamless series of stainless steel plates. The sculpture was inspired by liquid mercury and is one of the largest stainless steel sculptures of its kind, measuring 33 feet high and 66 feet in length! The sculpture is a popular tourist attraction thanks to its reflective properties that make for a great photo-op.
