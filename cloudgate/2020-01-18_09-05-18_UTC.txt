Miss Mila is back!!! Gosh I missed her. She’s one of my very first students who started private lessons with me back when I began 🎀⛸ in 2017, and she’s stuck with me coming up on 3 years. Here we are at The Bean last night, where we skated in a snowstorm! ❄️🌨☃️⛸⛸ It was quite challenging, and the zamboni had to come out every 15 minutes,...but we still had a blast anyway!!! 🤗 Grateful 🙏🏼 for my Mila and her continued loyalty to me. I must be doing something right.😊
