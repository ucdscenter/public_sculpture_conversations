A break during Backstage 2020, allowed me to make a quick visit at The Bean, which is just a block away from my hotel. 
Being at The Bean and seeing only very few people (There's always a big crowd at the place) were there at that moment, was a very pleasant surprise to me. Thank God. Perhaps since the Lord knows that for a long time now I've wanted to go there and get a photo of me being there...He was like "There you go, it's all to yourself. Enjoy!" The Cloud Gate also known as The Bean, is a world famous public sculpture by Indian-born British artist Sir Anish Kapoor, located at The Millennium Park in Chicago, Illinois. 
The sculpture, which was constructed in 2006, is nicknamed The Bean because of its shape. It is made up of 168 stainless steel plates welded together. It measures 33 by 66 by 42 feet and weighs 110 tons.

Kapoor's design was inspired by liquid mercury as its surface reflects and distorts the city's skyline. Visitors are able to walk around and under its 12-foot high arch.

The sculpture builds upon many of Kapoor's artistic themes. It is popular with tourists in the Windy City as a photo-taking opportunity for its unique reflective properties.
