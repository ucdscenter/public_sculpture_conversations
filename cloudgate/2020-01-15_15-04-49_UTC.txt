Chicago is the perfect weekend trip for any food and art enthusiast. The city boasts some of the best restaurants, bars and museums in the US. Besides visiting Anish Kapoor’s iconic Cloud Gate sculpture, be sure to  visit the Art Institute of Chicago, Frank Lloyd Wright’s Home and Studio in Oak Park and The Second City, the legendary stand up comedy club where some of the most iconic comedians on SNL started their careers (check out the Old Town Ale House right next door, where Anthony Bourdain filmed an episode of his CNN show!) Food wise, we highly recommend @parachutechicago in Avondale,  #fatricechicago for Chinese-Portuguese fusion, @girl.and.the.goat for bold flavors and #schwachicago for a highlight experience. There are too many more for one post! ☁️ @millykr
