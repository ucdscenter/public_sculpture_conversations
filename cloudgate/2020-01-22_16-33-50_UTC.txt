ILLINOIS: We had THE BEST time in Chicago last weekend. 😍 When I asked Trent if he wanted to go to Chicago in January, I’m not sure he was super excited🤔, but although it was cold🥶, the sun was shining☀️ and the sky was blue and the city was just beautiful😍! Cloud Gate was more stunning then I could have imagined😱 and we had so much fun exploring it!
