We spent a couple of days in Chicago on our way from Texas -> Sweden. A couple of things: I didnâ€™t know Chicago was so pretty! I also didnâ€™t know that it is quite lively. I didnâ€™t know that when we were being touristy at Cloudgate (along with the lady carrying a cat around) ðŸ˜º, that we were just a short walk from Lake Michigan. I didnâ€™t know that, despite sitting by a lake, it has a really dry climate. And...I certainly didnâ€™t know that I might almost lose my life (or a leg) taking a Lyft back from downtown to where we were staying. The Lyft driver felt really bad about it. Oh! And, lastly, I really didnâ€™t know that an airport pickup zone could be as intense as ORD. Seriously, just have your people do a slow roll, because there is zero stopping. ðŸ¤© See you next time, Chicago!
