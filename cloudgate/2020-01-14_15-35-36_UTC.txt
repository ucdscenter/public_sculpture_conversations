We celebrated my birthday in Chicago this past weekend! 
Here are the highlights:
The “bean” at @millennium_park 
The historic @chicagotheatre 
A fun #Friends popup experience on @themagmile 
Over the top dessert at @safehouse_chi 
More fun and learning than we could pack in to one day at @msichicago (good stuff in my “Chicago” story highlight)
Happy hour in the clouds at @signatureroom95 
Gorgeous terrace views at @trumpchicago 
An beautiful hotel room with the friendliest hotel staff we’ve ever encountered at @doubletreemagmile (those cookies tho!)
And as always a delightful travel experience with @southwestair.
Phew!
I need a vacation from my vacation.
