Was watching this series called Jojo's bizarre adventure. Let's call mine Ken's blizzard adventure. It's a public secret that I tend to get lost where 10 mins walking distance can suddenly translate to an hour of walk. That isn't cool when the temperature is -12deg or so (ok I admit it's cool enough). And because I'm really smart I didn't have a glove with me. Thankfully the 7 eleven guy was kind enough to sell me a pair of gloves and a cup of Chai latte, thus allowing me to proceed in my grand quest to find this famous bean in Chicago. #chicago #thebean #cloudgate
