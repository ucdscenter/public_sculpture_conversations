Cloud Gate //

Chicago ▪️2018
▪️▪️▪️
As stated here previously, architecture is also art.
As I visited Chicago, I needed to go to see one of its famous touristic points, the Cloud Gate (as also known as The Bean) . And I was marvelled. Not just with the sculpture itself but also with the infinite possibility of  cool pics I could take.
A note and a spoiler: if you visit my main account @ineslefty you can find pics of "The Bean" and The Mini Bean (me!). Also, I may or may not once travelled  all the way to Oporto to see one of Kappor's exhibition later on.
