The best day of our lives! 💍 I said yes to forever with my best friend yesterday. Stephen proposed to me in our favorite city the day after our 3 year anniversary and surprised me with our parents who were hiding in millennium park watching the whole thing. Everyone in the park was clapping for us and immediately after the song “Marry That Girl” came on by coincidence. He truly made it the most magical day and my dream proposal. I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you and start this new chapter.
