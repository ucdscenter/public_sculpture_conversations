So we made it to Chicago.

Ok so some may say I am crazy travelling for work with a herniated disc and going on for surgery in 2 weeks..... But it was business class and I have a high pain threshold and my other half travelling with me to look after me so all good!! Itâ€™s flipping cold here vs the U.K. but the cloud gate sculpture by @anish.kapoor was worth the wander out on the ice and snow!

Beautiful reflections of Chicago city.
