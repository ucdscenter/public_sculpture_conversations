🧧恭喜发财，新年快乐！祝大家鼠年吉祥，鼠年行大运！🧧Happy Chinese New Year to all my Family and Friends in Asia! Time flies and it’s been ten years since I celebrated Chinese New Year back home in Malaysia! I don’t think I remember how it feels like anymore 🤷‍♀️and I really miss the festive spirit there! The weather there is always sunny and nice during Chinese New Year and it is always great to enjoy quality time with people you love during the festive season! I really wish to be there! Perhaps next year? 
This photo was taken at the Bean during the summer time in Chicago’s Millennium Park. I wish it was always this nice in Chicago! Anyways, wishing everyone safe travels and a prosperous New Year ahead! 恭喜恭喜！🥰 #allenclovesmichellew #illinoiswmichelle🌆 #chicagowmichelle #usawmichelle🇺🇸 #usatravel #chinesenewyear2020 #新年快乐 #chicago #couplegoals💑
