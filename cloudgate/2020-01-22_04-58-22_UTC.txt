Sometimes you find yourself reflecting and you donâ€™t even realize it. 
Pictured: Cloud Gate... aka the Bean. Itâ€™s a Chicago treasure! 
Iâ€™ve visited Chicago dozens of times. I love this city. I love the culture, the food, the beaches, the skyline, I could go on for awhile. I also love how different it is in the summer compared to the winter. Let me tell you, if youâ€™ve never experienced summertime Chi, youâ€™re missing out. That being said, the winter is great too if youâ€™re up for a little cold and snow ðŸ˜‰
