#FMS_intheair
I’m way up IN THE AIR at the Chicago Athletic Club in the heart of Downtown.....right smack in the middle of Michigan Ave, overlooking the “Cloud Gate” which most people call The Bean. People don’t know I have a bit fear of heights, so taking a photo whilst standing in open air, 11 stories up is kinda a big deal for me. Lol! .
