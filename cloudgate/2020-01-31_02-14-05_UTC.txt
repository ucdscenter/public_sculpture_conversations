ILLINOIS: We had so much fun ice skating⛸ in Millennium Park under The Bean when we were in Chicago a few weeks ago!  Not going to lie, we were a little nervous about Chicago in January.🥶 But getting to experience the city in the winter was really a special treat. 😍 (That being said, we will for sure find our way back again in some warmer months!😂)
