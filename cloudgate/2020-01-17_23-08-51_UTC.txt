A Friday favorite, Chicago! Why do we travel? I have been lucky enough in life to travel for fun and work, feeding my constant sense of wonder and hunger to learn as much as possible (not to mention my love of food, but that's a seperate post ðŸ˜‰). I suppose the immersion factor that comes with travel is a big driver, as well. The world is so big and yet, so small, at the same time. I see these traits in my son, along with a Peter Pan-like sense of adventure that children possess, so I want to show him everything!  These are from a family multi- places-vacation, this past Summer.  We soaked up every precious moment together in this vibrant city with a deep soul. Chicago is an excellent pedestrian city and  offers so many different experiences, from the touristy  architecture sight-seeing river tours, exploring the Navy pier, the required photos by Buckingham fountain and  the " bean", to taking in the magnificent views from the John Hancock tower, as well as visiting locations like Thalia Hall ( the building in Disney's show,  Raven's Home) which has an amazing restaurant below it! (They serve dutch baby pancakes  and beignets! I will weave those into another post at some point) Chicago, we will be back again. ðŸ¥°ðŸ’•
