QUOTING Olli: "Something I always wanted to witness but was afraid I’m never going to. So surreal and even apocalyptic to see all those pastel colors during a Beautiful sunset. Did you know those clouds appear only couple of times a year at certain places? And that they actually destroy ozone?" || Please show support to our guest artists by visiting their IG gallery. .
