So I met this girl 174 days ago and little did I know I would be spending New Years with her and her family in Chicago. It has almost been 5 awesome months and I couldn't be happier! But to sum up the trip, we finally got good pics together, I saw snow for the first time, we saw more than enough Christmas lights and I got to take her flying when we got back. So yeah pretty successful trip‚ù§ and yeah swipe to the end to see me in my natural environment #chicago #cloudgate #jeep
