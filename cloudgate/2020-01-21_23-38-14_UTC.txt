I had never shot “The Bean” before, but my friend was in town from Las Vegas and was so excited to see it! We literally visited it 3 times in her short 3 days in town. We decided to have a little fun and take a shot at it and this is one of the few we came up with. I was pretty excited for someone who hadn’t done night photography in a few years and it made me want to explore it more over the years. .
