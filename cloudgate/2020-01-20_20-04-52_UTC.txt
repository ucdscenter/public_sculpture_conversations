It’s a bit warmer in @chicago today (27 degrees) & we’ve ventured out to see #cloudgate aka “The Bean”! Fascinatingly rounded & reflective, this iconic public sculpture was created by Indian born British artist #anishkapoor & located in @millennium_park ~ right across from @artinstitutechi ❄️ #art #sculpture #artist #artinstituteofchicago #saic #milleniumpark #motherdaughter
