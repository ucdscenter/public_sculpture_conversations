In Norwegian, the letter ‘k’ is often pronounced quite softly, akin to a ‘sh’ sound. Chicken for example is spelt ‘kylling’, which is then pronounced like ‘shylling’ in English. In a particularly fun coincidence, the Norwegian word for ‘sky’ is ‘himmel’, while the word for ‘cloud’ becomes ‘sky’ (so ‘shy’).
