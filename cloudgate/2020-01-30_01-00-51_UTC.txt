WHAT TO DO & EAT IN CHICAGO {save this 📌 & share with your friends}⁣
⁣
One of the best cities in 🇺🇸 no debate necessary. These are the things you MUST cross off your list 📝 when you’re there!⁣
⁣
✔️ @skydeckchicago (pictured) : Catch the best bird’s-eye view of the city (if anyone tells you otherwise they’re lying) & if you’re fearless get your picture sitting on top of the famous glass box 😰 — Don’t forget to check the weather BEFORE purchasing your tickets online because you may be signing up on a day where there’s zero visibility & they WILL take your 💰 knowing you won’t see a thing when you get up (it’s happened to me 😩)⁣
⁣
✔️ CloudGate aka “The Bean” : Get there early or you’ll be forced to photoshop all the intruders out of your pictures 😅 ( you didn’t go to Chicago if you don’t go here 🤷🏾‍♀️) ⁣
⁣
✔️ Try deep-dish 🍕 @pequodspizza .Thick, carmalized, with a thin layer of cheese along the outer crust. Rated # 4️⃣ out of 101 best pizza’s in the country!⁣
⁣
✔️ Visit a Rooftop Bar 👇🏾 (3 of the best!)⁣

✔️ Sushi 🍣 Lover? Some of the best sushi I’ve ever had is served @therealsushisan ! Definitely order the Tako Taco as an appetizer (you might order a 2nd because it’s soooo good!)⁣
⁣
✔️ Do breakfast the right way @batterandberries and berries. Serving over 50 different variations of French toast 😱. Best Brunch spot period. Google it.⁣
⁣
✔️ Visit Lincoln Park where you’ll find the honeycomb structure that’s the perfect photo op.⁣

Chicago is my favorite because it’s full of outdoor activities & diverse in food (my love language). Headed to Chicago? What’s first on your to-do list ?
