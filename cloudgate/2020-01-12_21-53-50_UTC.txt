These Ukrainian sisters are just too stinkin’ cute!!! If you swipe you’ll see ➡️ Stephania working on her marches in her new figure skates, and ➡️ Sophie learning forward swizzles for the first time. (She insisted I take a #boomerang of her swizzling, lol.) Both girls are working now to pick up speed, but the strange and funny thing is...is that they only skate faster when I coach them in the Ukrainian language than when I speak to them in English!! 😆🤣 I guess the word “скоренько” really is more intimidating and motivating rather than just saying “go faster.” I think it’s time I start coaching with a heavy Ukrainian accent in English to all of my students to ensure maximum results for everyone!! 😂😂😂
