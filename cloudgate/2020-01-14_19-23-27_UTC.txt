According to my Uber driver, it was a 3.5 minute ambitious visit to the bean hoping there is no sun, and tourist crowd in the middle of the day. Anish Kapoor’s Cloud Gate, in its winter glory (OK-OK, glory happened two nights ago!) There is nothing more I wanted for “self” on this sleepless, busy and tiring work trip. Is cloud gate the ultimate within-without nirvana? Selflessly reflect the mood around while being selfishly superficial?
