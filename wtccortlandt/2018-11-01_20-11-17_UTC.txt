Ann Hamilton’s CHORUS at the WTC Cortlandt Station in NYC. The marble mosaic - Preamble to 1776 US Declaration of Independence intersecting with 1948 UN Declaration of Human Rights. With the repetitions and layering, I also hear in the insistence the stuttering, as in our ability to articulate fully, or language’s capacity to do so, as in a celluloid frame, how the appearances of movement are always made up of still parts. #annhamilton #wtccortlandt
