This year, #InternationalDayofPeace marks the 70th anniversary of the @unitednations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which is a featured source in the new WTC Cortlandt Street station art installation, “CHORUS” by #AnnHamilton. The words inspire us to continue on a path of #peace in our local communities and beyond.
