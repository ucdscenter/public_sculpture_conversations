Newly opened World Trade Center Cortlandt station. After the 9/11 attacks, the subway station on the corner of Church and Dey Street was compromised by the thousands of pounds of debris that rained down from the collapsing twin towers above. On Saturday, September 10th, 2018, the transit officials reopened the station to the public as WTC Cortlandt Station.
