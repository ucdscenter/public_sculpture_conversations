This year, #HumanRightsDay marks the 70th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, a milestone document that proclaimed the inalienable #rights which everyone is inherently entitled to as a human being â€“ regardless of race, color, religion, sex, language, political or other opinion, national or social origin, property, birth or other status. It is the most translated document in the world, available in more than 500 languages.
