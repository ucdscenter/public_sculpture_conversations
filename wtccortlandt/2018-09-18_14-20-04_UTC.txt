I’m serving on jury duty today. It got me thinking about my recent visit to see #AnnHamilton’s gorgeous new #publicart project CHORUS at the #wtccortlandt station which re-opened last week after its destruction in 2001. The 4,350 sf bas-relief marble mosaic installation is a concordance of the Declaration of Independence woven together with the 1948 UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
.
We commissioned the project several years ago. Of all the proposals we received for this significant site, Ann’s project immediately touched a chord that was clear, clarion, civic and aspirational. It reminds us who we are as Americans and who we are as citizens of a wider world. That message has never been more essential. I feel proud to have been on the team that advocated and worked to bring this project to life.
.
Hearty congratulations to my former colleagues at @mtaartsdesign,  @mayerofmunich and @mtanyctransit for realizing this complex work and for creating a meaningful and historic addition to the public art collection in our transit system and our city. Go see it!
