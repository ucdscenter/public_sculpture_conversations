Its been 17 years since this station (Cortlandt St-WTC) had been destroyed and fully repaired and functioning again after the 9/11 attacks. 
A beautiful station with air conditioners to keep station cool with the Decleration of Independence printed on one wall, and the 1948 United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

A then and now of the station will be coming soon.
