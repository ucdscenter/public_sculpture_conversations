A subway station in New York has reopened for the first time since it was destroyed 17 years ago. WTC Cortlandt opened on Saturday, replacing the old Cortlandt Street station that was buried under debris when the two World Trade Center towers collapsed in the 11 September 2001 terrorist attack. Ann Hamilton's artwork 'Chorus' is featured in marble on the station walls, including text from the US declaration of independence and the 1948 UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
