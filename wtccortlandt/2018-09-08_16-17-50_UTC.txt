With the re-opening of the WTC Cortlandt Street (1) station, MTA Arts & Design proudly presents “CHORUS” (2018), a new monochromatic marble mosaic by renowned artist #AnnHamilton, fabricated by @mayerofmunich. “CHORUS” marks the historic site below the former #WorldTradeCenter with a field of text in mosaic bas-relief, weaving the words from the US Declaration of Independence with the 1948 UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, meant to acknowledge the civic ideals and aspirations of humanity and society. The 4,350 square feet of white-on-
white tactile surface invites subway riders to engage with the words as they touch the text, creating the opportunity for meaningful personal encounters.
