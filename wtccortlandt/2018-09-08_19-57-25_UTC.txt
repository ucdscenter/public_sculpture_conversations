September 11, 2001 was very tragic, but did you know that it made a station collapse? That's right, Cortlandt Street was closed since it happened. As of September 8, 2018 at 11:54 AM, almost 17 years after the attack happened, Cortlandt Street has reopened and was renamed to WTC Cortlandt. The 100 year old station can be accessible from the WTC Oculus. (TAGS):
