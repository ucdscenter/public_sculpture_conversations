What a beautiful station, it is definitely worthy of how all stations should look like. It is air conditioned, very big, bright and modern. We will never forget what happened a few hundred feet above the station. It has been 17 years since the name Cortlandt Street has been a stop on the 1 train and it is connected to the equally beautiful Oculus. Welcome back in service Cortlandt Street. #mta #downtownmanhattan #worldtradecenter #wtccortlandt #1train #oculus #911 #091101
