On #HumanRightsDay, we commemorate the day in 1948 when the @unitednations General Assembly adopted the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which is now permanently embedded into the fabric of New York City at the WTC Cortlandt (1) Station in #AnnHamilton’s marble mosaic “CHORUS” (2018). This document proclaims the unalienable rights which everyone is inherently entitled to as a human being.
