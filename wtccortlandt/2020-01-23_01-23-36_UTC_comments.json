        "text": "The Cortlandt Street station was destroyed on September 11, 2001. Although service on the Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line through the area was restored in 2002, the station's reconstruction was delayed until 2015 because the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey had to first rebuild the World Trade Center PATH station beneath it. After an extensive reconstruction, the Cortlandt Street station reopened on September 8, 2018, as WTC Cortlandt.",
