Congratulations to the 2019 CODAawards winner in the Transportation category, @mayerofmunich! "CHORUS" is located at the World Trade Center Hub in lower Manhattan. The locality is home to 60,000 residents, 300,000 daily commuters, 13 subway /PATH train lines, multiple ferries and 15 million annual travelers. Nearby are Santiago Calatrava's Occulus, the 911 Memorial and Museum – a forceful mix of remembering the past and embracing the future. Ann Hamilton’s meaningful and monumental work is now an inextricable part of this historic site. Ann Hamilton wanted to make a seamless connection to this powerful confluence of architecture and history. “CHORUS” is based on two historic texts woven together – the horizontally placed text is from the 1948 United Nations Declaration of Human Rights -- and is interwoven with vertical text from the preamble of the U.S. Declaration of Independence, which functions as a kind of “chorus” or “refrain” through repetition of key words and concepts. Hamilton’s text-based artwork spans both platforms of the number 1 line, totaling over 4,000 square feet, and utilizing approximately 10 tons of carrera marble. Hamilton worked with the Swedish typographer, Hans Cogne to find the right fit for these founding documents which emphasize the ideals and goals of our nation. They settled on “Trajan” which is a contemporary font modeled on inscriptions from Roman monuments. bit.ly/2019CODAawards 🏆
