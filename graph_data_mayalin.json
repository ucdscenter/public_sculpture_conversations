In Southeastern Ohio, where the artist grew up, there exist many #burial and effigy mounds from the time of the Hopewell and Adena #tribes - between 1000BC and 700 AD. One of the most striking is a mound in the shape of a #snake - the Serpent Mound. When European settlers first encountered these works and their accompanying artifacts, they were convinced that the forbears of the present day Native Americans could not have been sophisticated enough to produce them\n.\n.\nIn quest'opera, Maya Lin esplora la relazione tra lo spazio a due e tre dimensioni e la connessione tra le forme preistoriche delle Americhe e dell'Europa. Nell'Ohio del sud-est, dove l'artista \u00e8 cresciuta, esistono molti tumuli funerari ed effigi dai tempi delle #trib\u00f9 Hopewell e Adena - tra il 1000 e il 700 d.C. Uno dei pi\u00f9 sorprendenti \u00e8 un tumulo a forma di #serpente: il Serpent Mound. Quando i coloni europei incontrarono per la prima volta queste opere e i loro artefatti, furono convinti che i precursori dei nativi americani non avrebbero potuto essere abbastanza sofisticati per produrli\n.\n.\n#elevenminuteline #mayalin #landscape #landscapearchitecture #landscapedesign #artinnature #landscapefirst #contemporaryart #landart #arteambientale #landscapelovers #paesaggio #architetturadelpaesaggio #artecontemporanea #landskapsarkitektur #landskaps #landskabsarkitektur #landskab #landschaftsarchitektur #architecturedupaysage #arquitecturadelpaisaje #landform @wanaskonst",

Generously illustrated and beautifully designed,\u00a0Systematic Landscapes\u00a0traces her continued fascination with geologic phenomena and topography, integrating natural contours and materials into evocative landscape sculptures such as\u00a0Character of a Hill Under Glass\u00a0(2002) and\u00a011 Minute Line\u00a0(2004).\nAs the book reveals, Lin\u2019s earthworks and public sculptures have always developed alongside small-scale, exploratory sculptures and monumental temporary installations, such as\u00a0Avalanche\u00a0(1998), through which Lin evokes the physical processes that shape the earth. This important volume also introduces three major new installation works created for the \"Systematic Landscapes\" exhibition, along with a series of related drawings and reliefs demonstrating the expanding scope of Lin\u2019s creative process. The largest of these installations,\u00a02 x 4 Landscape, is composed from more than 45,000 sections of lumber placed on end that from a distance take on a pixel-like image of a hill, and close up create a form that evokes both mound and wave, earth and water.\nSystematic Landscapes\u00a0is of interest to newcomers to Maya Lin's work as well as to longtime enthusiasts of her unique artistic creations and stunning design work\n...\n...\n...\n...\n#mayalin #systematiclandscapes #contemporaryart #centreforpolitedissent #radicalarchive #bimpocscholarship #emilycarruniversity #ECUAD #ronburnettlibrary #library #vancouver #yvr #antiracistsylabus #antiracist",

She\u2019s the one that as a student won the contest to design the Vietnam War Memorial in DC, created the Ecliptic public park in Grand Rapids and now this!  Focusing on her fascination with water and taking common building materials, she\u2019s built these sculptures with the use of charting, mapping, and scientific research.\n\nThis particular sculpture is called Blue Lake Pass where particleboard is used to create a topographical landscape of this pass in the Rocky Mountains. Gridded by 3-foot square sections, I was able to walk through the narrow pathways and shift my perspective about the land and its geological scale.\n\nYou can find works like this and other classical and modern art all in one place right in the heart of downtown Grand Rapids.  I loved how it wasn\u2019t an overwhelmingly large museum. With 3 main levels, there was plenty to be fascinated by without getting bored or tired which to me is \ud83d\udd11. The collections also vary so greatly that it doesn\u2019t feel monotonous either.  Great spot to add to your Grand Rapids itinerary!\n\n#sponsored #goingawesomeplaces #experiencegr #grandrapids #puremichigan #michiganders #mittenlove #puremittigan #michigrammers #grmi #grnow #grandnew #downtowngr #puremichiganders #grandrapidsart #grandrapidsartmuseum #mayalin",

Best known for her design of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C., which received the prestigious 25-Year Award from the American Institute of Architects, Lin is passionate about sustainability and using natural elements in her work. This is best represented by her work \"Storm King Wavefield\" at Storm King Art Center in New York, in which she used low-impact grasses and natural drainage system to create an organic, living work that continues to evolve. In 2016, she was honored with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by Barack Obama. We're inspired by Maya Lin's dedication to environmental awareness through her work, especially at a time when climate change is fiercely at the forefront in today's political landscape.\n\nRegram: @madsqparknyc\n#mayalin #architecture #KGE #culture #womanpower #girlboss",

The material has since captivated her: \u201cIt was like opening a box of water,\" she has said. \"They capture light in a way I had never seen.\" Check out this time-lapse video of three of our summer interns, Jodie Cen @_cyz_jodie, Lexie Liu @lexie_lxr, and Nicholas Malkemus @n_malkemus, installing Interrupted River: Penobscot with Lin\u2019s studio assistant, James Ewert. Comprised of marbles adhered directly to the gallery wall, the installation took place over the course of three days earlier this month.\nYou can see this work and many more in Occupy Colby: Artists Need to Create on the Same Scale That Society Has the Capacity to Destroy, opening at the Museum this weekend.\n\u2026\n#MayaLin #ColbyMuseum #SummerInterns Exhibitions #Installation #BehindTheScenes #SneakPeek #Process #TimeLapse",

I love the part where Joan glides with a swimming seal! #MayaLin shared my favorite statistic of the night from #whatismissing @worldeconomicforum - it costs $700 billion to curb climate change and globally we spend $681 billion on cigarettes each year. Imagine if every smoker donated to climate change instead of buying a pack! That\u2019s \u201ctwo birds with one tree,\u201d Maya says. #BryanMcfarlane shared his paintings of ocean water and @julesdeep from @woodshole_ocean presented video footage of an underwater volcano in the Mariana Trench. Love seeing those prehistoric forms! Lastly @djspooky_official performed with an angelic violinist. \nI got to met one of my art heroes, Joan Jonas, and connect with ocean and art lovers! I just love how we all add our voices to a positive future for our world! \ud83d\udc1a\ud83c\udf0a\ud83d\udc99\u2728 #ecologicalart #ecocontemporaryart #worldoceansweek #artforgood #environmentalart #artheros @unesco @unenvironment",

On view in a special exhibition commemorating the event is Lin's 2014 work \"Bay, Pond, & Harbor (Long Island Triptych),\" pictured here.\n-\nThe winner of the 2009 National Medal of Arts and a 2016 recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, #MayaLin\u2019s acclaimed work encompasses large-scale environmental installations, intimate studio artworks, architectural projects, and memorials. In her sculpture and drawing, Lin interprets the world through a twenty-first century lens, utilizing technological methods to study and visualize the natural environment. Blurring boundaries between two- and three-dimensional space, Lin sets up a systematic ordering of the landscape tied to history, time, science, and language.\n-\nImage: Maya Lin, \"Bay, Pond, & Harbor (Long Island Triptych)\" and details, 2014, recycled silver, 10' 4\" x 13' 3\" (315 cm x 403.9 cm), overall installation dimensions \u00a9\ufe0f Maya Lin",

It was designed by Maya Lin, who was a Yale graduate and is best known for creating the Vietnam Memorial in Washington, DC.  It is one of my all-time favorite pieces \u2014 both for its simple beauty but even more so for what it represents.  We still have a ways to go in terms of gender equality, but we are definitely making leaps and bounds!\u2800\n\u2800\n\u2800\nOn a different note, Instagram told me that my first post was exactly a year ago today!  Admittedly I still have mixed feelings about this space, but I have to say that overall it has been pretty fun. Many thanks to you for following along!",

            "text": "A Fold in the Field, Maya Lin, Gibbs Farm, Makarau, New Zealand, 2013\n.\nEncompassing approximately 30,000 square metres, \u201cA Fold in the Field\u201d is Maya Lin\u2019s largest and most ambitious #earthwork to date. It is Lin\u2019s first earthwork depicting folds in the #earth of which there are five in total, the highest of which gently rises to 11.5 metres. Set on a flat plain, the folds emerge and billow from the terrain, the slopes determined with The Farms wildlife in mind, permitting the sheep to graze the slopes and keep the #grass the appropriate length. This is consistent with her large-scale environmental artworks, and the artist\u2019s interest in how one experiences and relates to the #landscape. Lin\u2019s five folds make dramatic new wave forms in the flattest and lowest section of the Farm: the coastal flats\n.\n.\nCon una superficie di circa 30.000 metri quadrati, \"A Fold in the Field\" \u00e8 la pi\u00f9 grande e ambiziosa opera di landart di Maya Lin fino ad oggi. \u00c8 la prima opera di Lin che descrive le pieghe nella terra, ne sono presenti cinque in totale, la pi\u00f9 alta delle quali sale dolcemente a 11,5 metri. Situate su una pianura piatta, le pieghe emergono e ondeggiano dal terreno, le pendenze studiate secondo la fauna selvatica di The Farms, permettendo alla pecora di pascolare le pendici e mantenere l'erba della lunghezza appropriata. Questo \u00e8 coerente con le sue opere d'arte ambientale su larga scala e l'interesse dell'artista per come si vive e ci si relaziona con il #paesaggio. Le cinque pieghe di Lin creano forme drammatiche ondulate nella parte pi\u00f9 piatta e bassa della fattoria: la pianura costiera\n.\n.\n#afoldinthefield #mayalin #gibbsfarm #newzealand #landart #landscapelovers #artinnature #landscapedesign #arteambientale #art #contemporaryart #landschaft #paisaje #paysaje #kunst #paisage #architetturadelpaesaggio #landscapearchitecture #landscapefirst #arquitecturadelpaisaje #design #artwork #landscapephotography #naturaldesign @mayalinstudio",

            "text": "Maya Lin is probably most well know for her work in Washington, DC, the Vietnam War Memorial. She was just 21 when her design was chosen for the Vietnam War Memorial through a contest. Maya Lin was born in Athens, Ohio. Her work can be seen all over the country including the campus of Ohio State and right here in Cleveland!\n\nIf you have ever been downtown to the Cleveland Public Library and ventured into the Linda Eastman Reading Garden you may have noticed Maya's fountain. It is a gentle flowing fountain made up of granite paving blocks with a poem inscribed on it. The reading garden was redesigned and dedicated in 1998, after the Louis Stokes wing of the library was added.\n\nThe reading garden is a peaceful place right in the middle of the hustle and bustle of downtown Cleveland. Totally worth a stop or a sit!\n\nLearn more about Cleveland on a walking tour! www.toursofcleveland.com\n.\n.\n.\n#cle #216 #cleveland #publicart #freeart #readinggarden #publiclibrary #cledowntown @clevelandpubliclibrary #downtowncleveland #mayalin #fountain #thisiscle #localcle #clevelandhistory #artoutside #visitmeincle #explorecleveland #exploreohio #ohiofindithere #theohio100 #ohioexplored #ohioartists #clegram #clevelandgram #toursofcleveland",

            "text": "Hi. It's Jeff @coseedphoto here along for the ride this week. Let's work together to uphold the greatness normally filling this feed. The close of the calendar year is a natural time to reflect; I propose we do just that over the next 6 days. Ask yourself / share with us :\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nWhat is the most significant image you made in the last twelve months?\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nTag #thebeautifulreal_reflect and include in your caption an explanation of the significance. Perhaps it marked a life milestone. Or got published. Or sparked a ginormous client order. Or helped someone heal. Or is the first image you made for yourself in too long. Or won an award. Or absolutely, positively failed - the byproduct of a seemingly brilliant idea poorly executed (I made quite a few of these this year) - but which moved your work forward! Or something else entirely. You tell us.\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nFor a little kicker this week, between now and next Saturday 3 shares from #thebeautifulreal_reflect will be selected to receive an archival pigment print of their most significant image. For you to do with as you please - frame and hang at home, gift, tape to the ceiling above your bed so it haunts you when you fall asleep/wake-up, or use to hone your dart game. Whatever works for you.\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nDig deep. Let's see what you've got.\u2063\u2063\n\u2063\u2063\nTo get the ball rolling, a couple images of my daughter. My reflection on these images in the comments below.",

            "text": "14/100. A inicios de los 80 una joven estudiante de arquitectura, de sus cursos finales, present\u00f3 una sint\u00e9tica, abstracta y sutil propuesta para un concurso que buscaba erigir un monumento a los Veteranos de la guerra de Vietnam. La guerra fue uno de los momentos m\u00e1s oscuros y cr\u00edticos de los 60 en Estados Unidos. El recuerdo, vivo, tangible, dram\u00e1tico, en un momento donde el entusiasmo por las reformas econ\u00f3micas de Reagan iban a dirigir el gigante del norte a una atalaya de desarrollo. Entre medio de todo esto, esta joven estudiante de arquitectura, con una escueta imagen pastoril y sublime a la vez cautiv\u00f3 a los jueves para volver Vietnam en una experiencia de muerte y vida en los visitantes, un contraste entre lo que al nivel de la calle era una realidad y bajo tierra, en una profunda opacidad de la piedra pulida era pura frontalidad. La arquitecta se llama Maya Lin y su environment \"Vietnam Veterans Memorial\". El campo que alter\u00f3 para siempre ser\u00eda el de los monumentos conmemorativos tan dados a abrazar el poder y su imagen can\u00f3nica. En su reemplazo propuso los memoriales, espacios, entornos, que buscaban generar emotividad y afecci\u00f3n en los visitantes, no la unicidad del rostro y sus atributos. Con eso cambi\u00f3 el paisaje del #publicart para siempre. Por estos d\u00edas se habla de un profundo cuestionamiento de los monumentos @andres_duran_d que los vuelve d\u00factiles a la calle y reactivos al mensaje, utilitarios para la fotogenia, pero esteriles en su significancia. C\u00f3mo recordaremos este momento hist\u00f3rico iniciado el 18 de octubre? C\u00f3mo recordaremos el proceso de #nuevaconstitucion ? Ser\u00e1 visto con esperanza? Se transmitir\u00e1 la imagen de un nuevo Chile o bien caeremos en los vicios de su versi\u00f3n 1.0? #mayalin #memorials pd: qu\u00e9 registro fotogr\u00e1fico m\u00e1s vivo.",

Truly one of my favorite places on this planet. \nSince 1993, I've spent so many magical afternoons in that ever-shifting landscape among the #AlexanderCalder #MarkDiSuvero #AndyGoldsworthy #MayaLin #JeromeKirk #IsamuNoguchi #NamJunePaik and #RichardSerra , whose #SchunnemunkFork never ceases to blow my mind.\n\nThe fun I've had introducing so many friends to the park, lulled there myself by my friend #RobertCamp who so loved the place himself. I\u2019m on an opposite coast at the moment, but some part of my heart is still hanging out, year-round, at Storm King.\n\n#AbiSebaly #MichaelRuppel #DavidSpear #ElizabethBradley #ArnieApostol #JoshJohnson #pureimagination #JordanElkind #TambraDillon #mindblown #MotherNature #gorgeous #burymyheartatSchunnemunkFork #showyourfriendswhatyoulovemost",

Although she proposed an apolitical monument, the design proved controversial. Veterans groups criticized her design and complained that it seemingly honored only the fallen and not the living veterans. Lin defended her design in front of the US Congress, and eventually, a compromise was reached. Lin's work has shaped our public consciousness and given women like us inspiration to change the world. #architectureofwomen #mayalin",

            "text": "Unexpected Connection.  Vietnam War Memorial.  Washington DC (2019)\n.\nMuch respect and kindest regards to anyone who made the ultimate sacrifice, and to those surviving the pain of loss...\n.\nFor my 200th IG post, I had envisioned some epic photo from some epic place.  I still have a few.  Memorial Day made this more appropriate.  Cold and threat of rain contributed to the sadness of this moment.  Yes, I had visualized catching a photo like this.  But I wasn\u2019t prepared for The Girl\u2019s connection. Maya Lin is her favorite architect.  She has a favorite architect!  Who knows if she fully absorbed the gravity and meaning of this hallowed ground.  But I do feel that she had an intuitive response, and understood the sadness of this place.  She felt a need to re-stand each flower that had fallen over.  Let me say, I\u2019ve been here three times now and I\u2019ve seen it through misty eyes each time. This is the first time I\u2019ve seen it through a photographer\u2019s lens. Photography is more difficult when you\u2019re fighting back tears.\n.\n.\n#memorialday#dcmemorial#dcmemorials#dcvietnammemorial#vietnammemorial#mayalin#natgeokids#natgeoyourshot#atlasobscura#natgeomyshot#nationalmall#memorialweekend#mdw2019#dcfocused#fotodc#instadc#nationalmallnps#dctography#showthemtheworld#runwildmychild#travelokido#photoparade#opbphotos#travelingfamily#kidswhoexplore#thevisualcollective#shotoncanon#canonrebel",

            "text": "10 years ago I travelled to the Pacific Northwest (USA) in search of a farsighted art project designed to connect Native American, European and Scientific communities. Led by architect Maya Lin and a super passionate not-for-project organisation, @confluencenw now sits as a series of six timeless (& functional) artworks dotted along the Columbia River. They range from a stunning polished basalt fish-cleaning table to an epic wildlife/pedestrian bridge (pictured). As a landscape architecture graduate, originally my interest was in the role of design to create cross-cultural and ecological awareness. Inspired by Australian Aboriginal songlines I saw this as a contemporary co-dreaming trail, a healing project that could unite people through a common care for their environment. In this case, a river system. There's more work to do. The final and seventh site at Celilo Falls, where traditional fishing runs have fallen silent due to damming, remains the greatest place of hurt.\n\nThe project team is focusing their energy on a school education program called 'Confluence in the Classroom'. Conceived by Warm Springs Elder and Artist Lillian Pitt, the learning experience gives young people a direct relationship to precious 'culture bearers' and the opportunity to see the world through Indigenous eyes. Last year the program connected around 12 Native American artists with over 1000 school children.\n\nFrom that point of view, the biggest legacy of Confluence is filling a gap in Indigenous history and living culture within the education system. Donors from the community have said, this is important and they're not getting this exposure elsewhere, until now. In 2017, the Oregon legislature enacted Senate Bill 13 'Tribal History/Shared History' which requires the state's Department of Education to create K - 12 Native American curriculum. With this new mainstream vehicle, all the hard work is set to pay off. \nArt & community laid foundations for a world class Indigenous education experience that could be modelled by schools around the globe. Change is in motion.\n\nPs: Parents, teachers, Confluence's website/online library is a great reference if you're looking where to begin.",

The two new major commissions are The Princeton Line, an undulating sculpted line of molded earth that travels a steep slope, and Einstein\u2019s Table, a granite \u201cwater table,\u201d both important additions to the University\u2019s public art collection, which is already deemed to be among the finest in the nation.\n\nThis event is free and open to the public and will take place on stage in Richardson Auditorium. Reserve tickets through tickets.princeton.edu or call 609-258-9220. Tickets will also be available at the door until 4:50 pm and while supplies last.

Sound on..\nMaya Lin's Sounding Stones was installed outside the Federal Courthouse Plaza in 1996. Consisting of four sequentially placed granite blocks, each cut through to create viewing holes to see neighboring blocks or to see and hear water fountains contained within the blocks, they mark the pedestrians' path between the path between the Worth and Earl Street entrances to the Federal Building. Each stone averages six feet square, but varies in separation between blocks. \n#mayalin #mayalinsculpture #nyc #nycart #downtownnyc #federalcourthouseplaza #soundingstones #pearlstreet #newyorkcity",

At age 21, she won a competition to design the Vietnam War Memorial. Her pared down, non- traditional design was controversial at the time, but it's now visited by 10,000 people each day. This also marked the start of a flourishing career. She went on to design a memorial to the civil rights movement & many other landscape installations and buildings.

It\u2019s also a @confluencenw site, one of five completed art landscapes by #mayalin along the Columbia River system. Today, we installed two signs that connect people with this amazing story and this historically significant place. The signs are a reminder that we walk on Indigenous land. Thanks to our graphic designer Christine Rains! Thanks also to the partners who made these signs possible: The Jackson Foundation, the Lewis and Clark Trail Heritage Foundation and the East Multnomah Soil and Water Conservation District! And finally, thanks to the sign fabrication and installation crew at Sea Reach!",

            "text": "Ellen S. Clark Hope Plaza, Maya Lin, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, #Missouri, #USA, 2010\n.\nFrom the designer words: I wanted to create the effect of floating, surrounded by a #pool of water lilies. I utilized a significant grade change from one side of the pool to the opposite side to create a #circular body of water that you could step onto at grade. As one walks around the pool, the pool transforms into a cantilevered bowl with #water lilies floating in it. The plaza is part of the BJC Institute of Health at Washington University School of Medicine, where people who need to visit have some of the toughest and most untreatable diseases. I wanted to create a #quiet, #peaceful refuge with a simple bowl of #flowers surrounding them. The quote that is cut into the inner circle is from Emily Dickinson's poem \"Hope\"\n.\n.\nDalle parole della designer: volevo creare l'effetto del galleggiamento, circondato da una pozza di #ninfee. Ho utilizzato un cambio di grado significativo da un lato della piscina al lato opposto per creare un corpo d'acqua circolare calpestabile. Mentre si cammina intorno alla piscina, questa si trasforma in una ciotola a sbalzo con ninfee galleggianti. La piazza fa parte del BJC Institute of Health della Washington University School of Medicine, dove i pazienti hanno alcune delle malattie pi\u00f9 difficili e pi\u00f9 incurabili. Volevo creare un rifugio tranquillo e pacifico con una semplice ciotola di #fiori che lo circondi. La citazione incisa nel cerchio interno \u00e8 tratta dal poema \"Speranza\" di Emily Dickinson\n.\n.\n#ellensclarkhopeplaza #mayalin #washingtonuniversityschoolofmedicine #saintlouis #waterlily #hope #emilydickinson #speranza #landscape #landscapearchitecture #landscapdesign #landscapelovers #landscapefirst #paesaggio #architetturadelpaesaggio #paysage #healinggarden #watergarden #gardendesign @mayalinstudio",

            "text": "The Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. was dedicated on November 13, 1982 to honor the service members who had lost their lives during this controversial war. A site near the Lincoln Memorial was chosen and authorized by Congress and a design competition was announced. Maya Lin, a 21-year-old architecture student at Yale, won the blind competition. The artist and her minimalist design drew criticism: some detractors protested her Asian heritage, while others disliked the idea of the black granite monument with no ornamentation. Lin\u2019s idea was to create a symbolic open wound in the earth to replicate the grief over those who were lost. The finished memorial proved to be an immersive experience, as the names of the dead rise higher and higher the closer the visitor gets to the center of the memorial; at the same time, the shiny granite acts like a mirror, reflecting the faces of the living. This powerful combination, as well as the 58,320 names chiseled into the granite, inspired pilgrimages by Vietnam veterans and their families. Thousands of objects, including flowers, notes, dog tags, army boots, and other memorabilia have been left in tribute at what has come to be known fondly as \u201cthe wall.\u201d *\n*\n*\n#CourageousWomenLeaders\n#LeadershipLessonsFromHistory\n#leadership\n#history\n#herstory\n#VietnamVeteransMemorial #VietnamWar #VietnamMemorial\n#MayaLin\n#memorial\n#warmemorial",

            "text": "A little strange to say this is something we\u2019re looking forward to, but so it goes: artist and architect @mayalinstudio will be placing a grove of spectral cedar trees within New York\u2019s @madsqparknyc next June; it\u2019s part of her forthcoming summer 2020 installation focusing on how climate change has impacted forests around the world.\n\nLin has arranged to source these dead trees (Atlantic Cedars) from the Pine Barrens in New Jersey, which was significantly damaged by extreme salinization during Hurricane Sandy in 2012. Entitled Ghost Forest, the show draws its name from woodlands like the Pine Barrens that have died due to climate change, sea-level rise, and saltwater infiltration.

On the ground, \"Blue Lake Pass\" embodies the Rocky Mountains of Colorado, which are segmented and pulled apart so people can walk through. This represents how natural terrain is often systematized by people, and exemplifies Lin's passion for nature. \n#natureart #sculptor #musicspeaks #courtneybryan #artist #womenartists #sculptorart #architecture #architect #chicagogram #redefineclassical",

I like to read books about artists with my kids like *Women Artists A to Z\" by Melanie LaBarge, illustrated by Caroline Corrigan.  This book highlights both the well-known favorite female artists (of course Frida Kahlo and Georgia O'Keeffe) as well as interesting and diverse choices beyond like Bette Saar, Elizabeth Catlett, and Carmen Herrera.  It is a great intro for young and old readers alike as it is not too wordy (though it has further info in the back if you want to dig deeper) and the vivid illustrations are a delight and honor each artist's style.  Stay tuned to @picturebookny this month (and ok, every month) for more features on books on great female artists. Link in profile to purchase.",

            "text": "This memorial day we are celebrating the work of Maya Lin, the Chinese-American architect behind the design of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, one of the most visited memorials in the US. She is also the inspiration behind our 'Stone Stories' necktie. \u263a\ufe0f Her design was just the beginning though as additional memorials followed just feet from hers.\n.\nMaya Lin was only 21 years old and a senior at Yale when her anonymous design was selected, but its sleek black granite wall was immediately met with controversy as people claimed it was not representative of America or their efforts in the war. The design however stayed intact and was unveiled Nov. 1982.\n.\nThe same year, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial Fund commissioned Frederick Hart to create a sculpture for their monument. Two years later, the bronze Three Soldiers statue was unveiled just a few feet from the Vietnam Veterans Memorial wall. Tough to argue that the statue wasn\u2019t added to offer an alternative for critics of Maya\u2019s design\u2026\n.\nBut between these two memorials, only 8 women are represented by way of their names being etched on the wall. It has been reported that anywhere between 7,500 to 11,000 women served in the Vietnam War, with others claiming tens of thousands more as civilian women became more involved in the war. .\nEnter Diane Carlson Evans, a former Army nurse who led a campaign to get a memorial representative of the women that served in Vietnam. Her campaign was largely met with \u201cleave enough alone\u201d, but eventually, in 1993, the Vietnam Women\u2019s Memorial, sculpted by Glenna Goodacre, was unveiled 60 feet from the other memorials. The Vietnam Women\u2019s Memorial Foundation lists 67 American women - 8 military and 59 civilians gave their lives in the war. Swipe to see the three memorials.\n\n#happymemorialday #mdw #mayalin #vietnamveteransmemorial #memorialday #trailblazers #womenartists #womeninspiringwomen #womeninhistory",

While the Wavefield is beautiful to look at, one does not interact or connect with the landscape like we do on the golf course.  Lin\u2019s work impressively reclaims an old gravel pit and asks us to consider our relationship with that space, but the golfer in me was left wanting more!  #stormkingartcenter #stormking #golfarchitecture #shaping #earthworks #mayalin",

Blue Lake Pass is a landmark in the Rocky Mountains near where the artist has a summer home.

She gridded its terrain into 3-foot square sections, and then pulled the distinct sections apart, allowing visitors to walk narrow pathways through the landscape. \u201c I wanted to shift one\u2019s perspective about the land, allowing a viewpoint that is more geological in character\u201d",

And you know how lyrics that rhyme can get carried away?... yeah, well whatever, I'm feeling sarcastic today!\n'WANT TO FIND OUT' if curiosity is free? We'll come on in, the water's dark and deep. Every day begins a new #mystery, so Count Me In.\nToday's fate, tomorrow's history. \n#MayaLin #JennyHolzer #NancyRubins #ClaesOldenburg #FrankStella #HenryMoore #JamesTurrell #RichardLong #ARIA #bellagio #caesarspalace #cosmopolitanlasvegas #lasvegas #insta360oneX #lifein360 #360 #daretodream #theta360 #neverstopexploring #wanderlust  #cityoflights #vegas #insta360 #bullettime\n\n@jennyholzerstudio\n@arialv",

This building was designed by Maya Lin with Bialosky + Partners Architects and CannonDesign.\n\u2022\nLin writes of the building\u2019s design, \u201cI wanted to create a campuslike character for the Novartis community with this design. I envisioned a courtyard green-space within the compound's interior as a counterpoint to the hard-scaped plaza of Novartis's existing buildings directly across the street, as well as a garden for both Novartis's employees and the public.\u201d\n\u2022\nOf the unique facade, Lin writes, \u201cThe design of the stone facade is inspired by microscopic views of organic coral or bone structure. Conceptually I felt this translation of nature through a systematic and mathematical process reflects back on how science and medicine take materials found in nature and, through scientific analysis and research, transform them into new medicinal compounds.\u201d \ud83d\udcf7 @terrificshots\n\u2022\n@bialoskyarchitects @cannondesign @mvva.inc @novartis #BSAAIA #harlestonparkermedal #hpark19 #BSAdesignawards #architecture #architects #design #Boston #contemporary #beautiful #picoftheday #archilovers #archidaily #architecturedaily #research #science #biomedical #sciencelab #lab #laboratory #mayalin #womenartists #womenarchitects",

Just brilliant in every way. And terribly striking and authoritative in person. She holds a room. It\u2019s called Maya Lin 1:5, a 3D color scan of #MayaLin herself, 13 inches tall.

            "text": "#repost @landscape.first\n\u30fb\u30fb\u30fb\nEllen S. Clark Hope Plaza, Maya Lin, Washington University School of Medicine, Saint Louis, #Missouri, #USA, 2010\n.\nFrom the designer words: I wanted to create the effect of floating, surrounded by a #pool of water lilies. I utilized a significant grade change from one side of the pool to the opposite side to create a #circular body of water that you could step onto at grade. As one walks around the pool, the pool transforms into a cantilevered bowl with #water lilies floating in it. The plaza is part of the BJC Institute of Health at Washington University School of Medicine, where people who need to visit have some of the toughest and most untreatable diseases. I wanted to create a #quiet, #peaceful refuge with a simple bowl of #flowers surrounding them. The quote that is cut into the inner circle is from Emily Dickinson's poem \"Hope\"\n.\n.\nDalle parole della designer: volevo creare l'effetto del galleggiamento, circondato da una pozza di #ninfee. Ho utilizzato un cambio di grado significativo da un lato della piscina al lato opposto per creare un corpo d'acqua circolare calpestabile. Mentre si cammina intorno alla piscina, questa si trasforma in una ciotola a sbalzo con ninfee galleggianti. La piazza fa parte del BJC Institute of Health della Washington University School of Medicine, dove i pazienti hanno alcune delle malattie pi\u00f9 difficili e pi\u00f9 incurabili. Volevo creare un rifugio tranquillo e pacifico con una semplice ciotola di #fiori che lo circondi. La citazione incisa nel cerchio interno \u00e8 tratta dal poema \"Speranza\" di Emily Dickinson\n.\n.\n#ellensclarkhopeplaza #mayalin #washingtonuniversityschoolofmedicine #saintlouis #waterlily #hope #emilydickinson #speranza #landscape #landscapearchitecture #landscapdesign #landscapelovers #landscapefirst #paesaggio #architetturadelpaesaggio #paysage #healinggarden #watergarden #gardendesign @mayalinstudio",

            "text": "Artists have a variety of methods to make their mark. Every Friday we will share a photograph of an #ArtistInAction.\n.\nMaya Lin (b.1959) is an American designer and artist who works primarily in sculpture and land art to address historical moments and environmental issues. Using technology like sonar maps and satellite imaging, Lin\u2019s acute installations explore the relationship people have with their environment by bringing elements of nature into an urban setting. For example, in \u201cWater Line\u201d (2006) Lin used wire to reconstruct the topography of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which is the ocean floor north of Antarctica and one of the most remote places on earth. Bringing the contours of the bottom of the sea to an interior gallery space is indicative of Lin\u2019s astounding ability to synthesize momentous nature into an accessible viewing experience. Lin\u2019s most famous installation is the Vietnam Veterans Memorial (1981), which consists of two long mirrors with the names of fallen soldiers engraved on its surface. \"I'm very much a product of the growing awareness about ecology and the environment movement,\" Lin explains. \"I am very drawn to landscape, and my work is about finding a balance in the landscape, respecting nature not trying to dominate it. Even the Vietnam Veterans Memorial is an earthwork. All of my work is about slipping things in, inserting an order or a structuring, yet making an interface so that in the end, rather than a hierarchy, there is a balance and tension between the man-made and the natural.\"\n.\n#MayaLin @mayalinstudio \nImage: Courtesy of knoll.com",

            "text": "#mayalin is an American designer, architect, and artist who works in sculpture and land art. She achieved national recognition at the age of 21 while still an undergraduate at Yale University, when her design for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, D.C. was chosen in a national competition. It is considered one of the most influential memorials of the post-World War II period.\n\nLin has designed other memorials and numerous public and private buildings, landscape design, and sculpture. Although Lin's best known sculptures and architectural work are historical memorials, she also honors nature through her environmentally themed works. In creating works which deal with the environment in decline, Lin aims to raise awareness for the environment for audiences in urban spaces. Lin has stated that environmental issues have concerned her since she was very young, and she dedicated much of her time at Yale University to environmental activism.[10] Her interest in the environment stems from her upbringing in rural Ohio. The Hopewell and Adena Indian burial mounds inspired Lin from an early age. Much of her later work, after her work on memorials, focuses on the relationship that people have with their environment, which she displays in earthworks, sculptures, and installations. \"I'm very much a product of the growing awareness about ecology and the environment al movement,\" Lin says. \"I am very drawn to landscape, and my work is about finding a balance in the landscape, respecting nature not trying to dominate it. Even the Vietnam Veterans Memorial is an earthwork. All of my work is about slipping things in, inserting an order or a structuring, yet making an interface so that in the end, rather than a hierarchy, there is a balance and tension between the man-made and the natural.\" Lin's work centers on the concept of uncovering \"hidden histories\" to bring attention to landscapes and environments that may otherwise be inaccessible to viewers and \"deploys the concept to discuss the inextricable relationship between nature and the built environment.\" Lin's focus on this relationship highlights the impact humanity has on the environment, and draws attentio",

            "text": "Hi friends! ~This is Maya. We adopted this tiny little sweetiepie yesterday! Isn't she just the most beautiful little thing?! I have never seen this mocha color all over on a cat... and her eyes, if you could see in person, are literally patches of blue, green, gold, and gray with brown specks. Also a tiny white spot on her neck and one on her front paw. She has such a unique look.. I was drawn to her immediately. ~Maya has made herself right at home... has already met her extended family, human and fur, and she loves them all, and they, her. She is intelligent, observant, spunky, and snuggly... and we are already so in love and so so glad she picked us to bring her home. ~It has been a year since we lost our Benjamin, so it has not been a decision we have made lightly. But we knew she would be perfect for our little fur family. \nIn case you are wondering... she's named Maya for a few reasons... for the incredible artist Maya Lin... for one of my favorite cultures, the Maya... and her color also reminds me of Mayan chocolate and if you know us, you know all about how we feel about that! \u2764 Can't wait to watch her grow and as you can tell, she's already found her snuggle sweet spot with Zack. \u2764\n#cat #kitty #kittycat #kitten #newbaby #furbaby #furchild #petsnamedafterartists #petsnamedafterart #maya #mayalin #mayan #mocha #pretty #sweet #cuddles #oklahoma #myoklahoma #farmlife #countryliving",

The first modern Chinese #femalearchitect, she and her husband founded the field of Chinese historical architecture. Her niece, the architect and artist #MayaLin, best known for designing the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington, told Smithsonian Magazine in 2017 that \u201cmost people in China know more about Liang and Lin\u2019s personalities and love lives than their work...But from an architectural point of view, they are hugely important...If it weren\u2019t for them, we would have no record of so many ancient Chinese styles, which simply disappeared.\u201d They tirelessly tracked across rural China recording and attempting to preserve historical buildings.

On view in a special exhibition commemorating the event is Lin's 2014 work \"Bay, Pond, & Harbor (Long Island Triptych),\" pictured here.\n-\nThe winner of the 2009 National Medal of Arts and a 2016 recipient of the Presidential Medal of Freedom, #MayaLin\u2019s acclaimed work encompasses large-scale environmental installations, intimate studio artworks, architectural projects, and memorials. In her sculpture and drawing, Lin interprets the world through a twenty-first century lens, utilizing technological methods to study and visualize the natural environment. Blurring boundaries between two- and three-dimensional space, Lin sets up a systematic ordering of the landscape tied to history, time, science, and language.\n-\nImage: Maya Lin, \"Bay, Pond, & Harbor (Long Island Triptych)\" and details, 2014, recycled silver, 10' 4\" x 13' 3\" (315 cm x 403.9 cm), overall installation dimensions \u00a9\ufe0f Maya Lin #artandartist123 #123artandartist456",

There are places to picnic and a number of food vendors to purchase snacks or meals. I recommend getting there early - they open at 10 am, or go later in the afternoon when the light enhances the installations - open until 8pm.\n.\n#stormkong #sculptures #hudsonvalley #alxandercalder #calder #lyndabengalis #bengalis #markdisuvero #disuvero #andygoldsworthy #goldsworthy #richardserra #serra #mayalin #ursulavonrydingsvard #jeanshin #markdion #aliceayvock #siaharmajani #georgerickey #davidsmith #alexanderloberman #artadventures #art #artwork #glenngisslerdesign",

A school football game is about the players on the field, but it's also about the Waterboys, the spirit team, the band, the community cheering on their Alma mater. Turning towards the stands while on the field and plays are being made isn't the best idea, though. \ud83d\ude44\n\nAn art museum or a nature trail is the same way.  These things have intrinsic value, but the people who enjoy them are intrinsic to the being and value of these spaces. Seeing how other people and spaces interact (or don't) in a space is as interesting as one's own reactions. At least, to this artist.",

Her parents encouraged her to make art\u2014so when Maya wasn\u2019t studying, she was casting bronze at the university\u2019s foundry.\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nMaya studied architecture because it combined her passion for art, math, and science. In 1981, after she won the Vietnam Veterans Memorial competition, Maya faced harsh criticism by government officials, including President Ronald Reagan. At the time, her minimalist design went against traditional memorial architecture, so critics wanted to alter it. But Maya didn\u2019t cave in and even defended her work at a Senate hearing. But she prevailed and became the first woman to design a memorial on the U.S.\u2019s National Mall.\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nSince then, Maya\u2019s been unstoppable! She\u2019s designed large-scale environmental pieces, buildings, and monuments. Through her work, she educates viewers on different issues\u2014from social injustice to nature conservation. Some of her designs include the Civil Rights Memorial in Alabama, Yale\u2019s \u201cThe Woman\u2019s Table\u201d sculpture, and \u201cWhat Is Missing?\u201d, a project about extinct species and climate change. President Barack Obama awarded her with the National Medal of Arts and the Presidential Medal of Freedom for her work.\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nIn Maya\u2019s own words, \u201cto fly we have to have resistance.\u201d Maya\u2019s groundbreaking career is proof of what happens when we question tradition and persevere in the face of skeptics. \ud83d\udcf7: WSJ #mayalin #bravewomanhighlight",

            "text": "This shot is from my time with the #MyMuseumMonday program with the @desmoinesartcenter. Pictured here is Maya Lin\u2019s Rock Field. During my time, I set out to make improvisational pieces that communicated with and were informed by the environment of performing in tandem with others\u2019 art, sans audience. This particular improvisation was one of my favorites. Lin\u2019s Rock Field has an organic subtlety and sensuality to it that felt natural to commune with (especially in conjunction with the brutalist beauty of the late I.M. Pei\u2019s architecture surrounding us.) When I think back on how it felt to move in that space and exist in that moment in time... it was a genuinely spiritual experience for me that I will cherish for eternity. \u2022\n\n#mymuseummonday #artcentered #desmoinesdance #desmoinesart #impei #iowaart #mayalin #rockfield #glass #sculpture #improvisation #moderndance #gesture #beauty #brutalism",

            "text": "Today Storm King gave us the opportunity to reflect upon how sculpture is transformed by \u2014 and transforms \u2014 landscape. In Maya Lin\u2019s case, landscape becomes sculpture and sculpture becomes landscape. It also gave us the opportunity to get a little sunburnt, and to reconsider the wisdom of reenacting the Charlie\u2019s Angels pose in front of a yacht painted by Roy Lichtenstein. Most possibly the best day trip you can take in the Hudson Valley. Bring a lunch and eat in the shady picnic area by the South parking lot. \n#markdisuvero #mayalin #sollewitt #aliceaycock #ronaldbladen #alexanderliberman @stormkingartcenter @majmah45 @williammahoney1205 @gnmahoney2005 #",

If you want to see the previous 32 role models, check out my official page for @dimsum_love .\nNo. 33 is Maya Lin who was the first female architect to have designed a monument on our National Mall. The Vietnam War Memorial is a living tribute to the lives that we lost and has created a place of healing for a very questionable era of our nation\u2019s history. On a personal account, my father was an architect and steered me from being one, even though I had shown early interest in it. His main reason was that he didn\u2019t want to see his little girl pay the rough dues in a predominantly male profession at the time. Ironically, one of my father\u2019s Harvard GSD classmate, King-Lui Wu had taught Lin. That realization debunked that myth quickly for me. In the end, we are all meant to be on our perfect and imperfect paths.\n#100dayofasianrolemodels #asianportraits #dimsumloveart #dimsumlove #diversityillustration #asians #illustrationartists #illustration #illustrationportrait #artistsoninstagram #asianartist #representation #asianarchitects #mayalin #architectportrait #yalearchitecture #gouache #gouacheillustration @holbeinartistmaterials @derwentartofficial",

Her work is inspired by the balance and tension between the natural environment and man-made. She aspires to bring awareness to people of their surroundings, not just the physical world but also the psychological world we live in. \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800 \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n#mayalin #QOTD #artist #designer #inspirationalwomen #bossbabe #girlboss #fempreneur #chicagorealestate #chicago #environmentawareness #quote #strength #womensempowerment #empowerher #knowledgeispower #armenianwoman #arabic #smartisthenewsexy #arsiak #awomanforwomen #courage #smartwomen #inspired #femaleempowerment #futureisfemale #personaldevelopment #middleeasternwomen #womeninrealestate #mondaymotivation",

            "text": "I repost this image I shot in Washington DC years ago because it is so evocative of today\u2019s holiday. \nWe remember today the men and women who gave the ultimate sacrifice for us and our country. Their sense of duty - stronger than their sense of self.\nAs of May, 2018, there are 58,320 names - including eight women.\nThe high shine of the memorial is to capture our reflections, bringing the past and present together.\n\nThe names inscribed are not a complete list of those who are eligible for inclusion as some names were omitted at the request of families.\nThose who are declared dead are denoted by a diamond, and those who are status unknown are denoted with a cross. When the death of one who was previously missing is confirmed, a diamond is superimposed over the cross. If the missing were to return alive, which has never occurred to date, the cross is to be circumscribed by a circle.\nThe walls are sunken into the ground, with the earth behind them. At the highest tip (the apex where they meet), they are 10.1 feet (3.1 m) high, and they taper to a height of 8 inches (200 mm) at their extremities. Symbolically, this is described as a \"wound that is closed and healing\".\nStone for the wall came from Bangalore, Karnataka, India. It was chosen because of its reflective quality and also because of opposition to Swedish and Canadian stone, as those countries were destinations for draft evaders. One wall points toward the Washington Monument, the other in the direction of the Lincoln Memorial, meeting at an angle of 125\u00b0 12\u2032. Each wall has 72 panels, 70 listing names (numbered 1E through 70E and 70W through 1W) and two very small blank panels at the extremities.\n\nWithout them, I cannot imagine where our country would be today.\n\n#memorialday #vietnamveteransmemorial #rubbing #MIA #KIA #blackgranite #optimatypeface #mayalin #hands #reflection #nationalmall #neverforget #constitutionalgardens #washingtondc #remember #usmc #usarmy #usnavy #airforce #coastguard #armedforces \n@pbpost @time @petesouza @marines @nytimes @stripesphotography \u00a9\ufe0fM.

            "text": "Ettore Sottsass - 6. As an architect\u2019s son, who had studied architecture and started his career by working for his father, it\u2019s easy to understand why Ettore Sottsass should have decided to explore other areas of design after opening his own studio in 1946. He took on occasional architectural projects over the next forty years, including a friend\u2019s house in the Roman countryside in 1966, and a ceramics workshop in Tuscany three years later. But it was not the mid-1980s, when Sottsass left Memphis, that architecture became a focus of his work. One of his first projects was this, the Wolf House, designed in the late 1980s for the US photography dealer Daniel Wolf and his wife, the architect Maya Lin, near Mount Sneffels in Colorado. Stylistically, Sottsass\u2019s architecture shared the bold contrasts of colours, shapes, materials and symbolism of his work in product design, and conceptually it was steeped in the same post-modernist sensibility. Yet each of his buildings, the houses especially, was designed \u201cto be in\", as he put it, because Sottsass orchestrated the experience of entering or leaving a room, and moving between them, so skilfully.\n\n#design #architecture #ettoresottsass #wolfhouse #danielwolf #mayalin #tobein",

When asked what helped shape her design, Lin said \u201cI though about what death is, what a loss is. A sharp pain that lessens with time, but can never quite heal over. A scar. The idea occurred to me there on the site. Take a knife and cut open the earth, and with time the grass would heal it. As if you cut open the rock and polished it.\u201d Today we acknowledge and honor the sacrifice of so many and the grief and scars that their loved ones bear. \ud83d\udcf8Peter Marlow/Magnum Photos \n#memorialday",

            "text": "Three Legged Buddha (detail), 2007\nZhang Huan (b. 1965) @zhanghuanofficial\n\nZhang Huan is a contemporary Chinese artist based in Shanghai. He began his career as a painter, transitioned to performance art, then back to painting, while dabbling in several mediums like sculpture in between. The Three-Legged Buddha was his piece for the @stormkingartcenter. While the legs of the Three Legged Buddha are modeled closely after fragments of bronze Buddha sculptures Zhang encountered on a trip to Tibet in 2005, the sculpture\u2019s face\u2014visible only from the nostrils upward\u2014is a self-portrait. Zhang folds his body into his art, much as he did in the 1990s, when he came to prominence for performance-based work. Zhang designed the hatches in the sculpture to provide access to the interior so that incense might be burned inside, with smoke emanating through holes in the Buddha\u2019s toes, nostrils and eyes.\n\nI kept this postcard because it was the best one at the Stormking Gift Shop of the Three Legged buddha. In the summer of 2018, I visited the sculpture park (as made famous on Master if None) with @anniesoud and @henrylmn. It was a beautiful day, and even among the Andy Goldsworthys and Maya Lins, the Three Legged Buddha\u2019s was my favorite. It was the most human piece at Stormking\u2014surreal, strange and thought-provoking. \n#zhanghuan #stormking #threeleggedbuddha #andygoldsworthy #mayalin",

Lin has designed other memorials and numerous public and private buildings, landscape design, and sculpture. Although her most well known sculptures and architectural work are historical memorials, she also honors nature through her environmentally themed works.\n\nLin will be giving the 2019 @tannerhumanitiescenter  Tanner Lecture on Human Values this Wednesday at 7 p.m. at Kingsbury Hall. Her talk, titled \u201cArt and Social Responsibility, a Personal Response,\u201d will reflect upon her career as an artist and designer and discuss how her creative work connects intricately to history, politics, culture, and landscape. \nThere will be a Q&A at the end of the event.

It is number one on the  @tripadvisor list of things to do in Bentonville and I can see why!

The combination of indoor galleries and outdoor installations along the sprawling trails kept me busy for hours!\u2063\n\u2063\nAn unexpected highlight was getting to visit my second Frank Lloyd Wright structure, the Bachman-Wilson House. The home was originally built in New Jersey but due to threat of repeated flooding it was sold to the museum.

It is Lin\u2019s first earthwork depicting folds in the #earth of which there are five in total, the highest of which gently rises to 11.5 metres. Set on a flat plain, the folds emerge and billow from the terrain, the slopes determined with The Farms wildlife in mind, permitting the sheep to graze the slopes and keep the #grass the appropriate length. This is consistent with her large-scale environmental artworks, and the artist\u2019s interest in how one experiences and relates to the #landscape. Lin\u2019s five folds make dramatic new wave forms in the flattest and lowest section of the Farm: the coastal flats\n.\n.\nCon una superficie di circa 30.000 metri quadrati, \"A Fold in the Field\" \u00e8 la pi\u00f9 grande e ambiziosa opera di landart di Maya Lin fino ad oggi. \u00c8 la prima opera di Lin che descrive le pieghe nella terra, ne sono presenti cinque in totale, la pi\u00f9 alta delle quali sale dolcemente a 11,5 metri. Situate su una pianura piatta, le pieghe emergono e ondeggiano dal terreno, le pendenze studiate secondo la fauna selvatica di The Farms, permettendo alla pecora di pascolare le pendici e mantenere l'erba della lunghezza appropriata. Questo \u00e8 coerente con le sue opere d'arte ambientale su larga scala e l'interesse dell'artista per come si vive e ci si relaziona con il #paesaggio. Le cinque pieghe di Lin creano forme drammatiche ondulate nella parte pi\u00f9 piatta e bassa della fattoria: la pianura costiera\n.\n.\n#afoldinthefield #mayalin #gibbsfarm #newzealand #landart #landscapelovers #artinnature #landscapedesign #arteambientale #art #contemporaryart #landschaft #paisaje #paysaje #kunst #paisage #architetturadelpaesaggio #landscapearchitecture #landscapefirst #arquitecturadelpaisaje #design #artwork #landscapephotography #naturaldesign @mayalinstudio",

The Vietnam War Memorial is a living tribute to the lives that we lost and has created a place of healing for a very questionable era of our nation\u2019s history. On a personal account, my father was an architect and steered me from being one, even though I had shown early interest in it. His main reason was that he didn\u2019t want to see his little girl pay the rough dues in a predominantly male profession at the time.\n#100dayofasianrolemodels #asianportraits #dimsumloveart #dimsumlove #diversityillustration #asians #illustrationartists #illustration #illustrationportrait #artistsoninstagram #asianartist #representation #asianarchitects #mayalin #architectportrait #yalearchitecture #gouache #gouacheillustration @holbeinartistmaterials @derwentartofficial",

            "text": "Happy birthday, Maya Lin! \ud83c\udf82 \ud83c\udf88\ud83c\udf89 Maya was 21 years old when she won the design competition for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. She beat out more than 1,400 other entries. Her design, which was unique and untraditional, called for the memorial to made of polished granite. It would appear as a rift in the earth. The walls would be reflective so as to create a sense of personal reflection and private reckoning. She wanted people to be able to see themselves. The Wall would also be black - while everything else in Washington was white. To no surprise, this design caused controversy and uproar. Many derided it and she became a central part of the debate. Her design was called \"the black gash of shame.\" Others didn't like that she was a woman, and some didn't like that she was of Chinese descent. Maya, who was born in Ohio, fought hard and pasionately for her design. She didn't back down, and through talks and debates, and an eventual compromise - she prevailed. Since 1982, her simplistic design has evoked a powerful sense of honor and reflection. She has gone on to have a rewarding and successful career. Maya was born #onthisday in 1959.\n.\n.\n#birthday #architect #design #memorial #TheWall #VietnamVeteransMemorial #MayaLin #honor #remember #reflect #reflection",

            "text": "As a person with a cautious aversion to war memorials and monuments you would find me mostly straying away from these politically manipulated biases of memory.\n\nMaya Lin's Vietnam veteran memorial is an exception.\n\nA decade ago researching on it for a project, I was drawn to the empathetic and minimalist nature of her design and the subtle and powerful message it carried within but to have the opportunity to experience it was a whole different sensory journey (albeit a bit overloaded because of the crowds). Approaching the sunken black shard like wall emerging from the green lawn, one doesn't fully comprehend the scale of it all. Similar to how one approaches loss until you fully descend down the slope, until the names etched on the cool granite becomes visible to your naked eye. Inches away. Humans who lived. And at the apex, thousands of them. But now who exists only as a collection of letters. As you keep walking the names and the memories recess back to the soil and the ascending slope rejoins the elevation of the mall All along accompanied by your own reflection on the polished black wall. Making one reset on how we remember, how we view war and history, how we live with the wounds they inflict. And WHY we live.\n\n_ \u201cI imagined taking a knife and cutting into the earth, opening it up, an initial violence and pain that in time would heal.\u201d - Maya Lin\n\nImage 2 : Entry to the Vietnam veteran memorial competition via Library of Congress released to public domain.\nImage 3 by Terry Adams for Maya Lin studio \nImage 4 by Alvaro Maalo: Saatchi Gallery\n\n#mayalin",

            "text": "Maya Lin, one of my artistic heroes, the sculptor most well-known for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington D.C., has a work in New York's Penn Station, Eclipsed Time. Near the Long Island Railroad concourse. Most people even walk on top part of it on the floor below as they commute through the busy station every day. You have to look up in the ceiling to see the majority of the work. Now covered with construction apparatus and the wall text is nowhere to be found now. It is not currently working due to lighting issues. It was Installed back in 1994. A conceptual clock that tells time via the movement of light. Most people do not know we have such a work in NYC, our only Maya Lin that I know of. My wish is that they save the work as they renovate the train station. The next time you walk through Penn Station look up into the ceiling at the North east corner in the long corridor before you approach the red line (1,2,3) subway entrance.\n.\n.\n.\n#mayalin#mayalinstudio#eclipsedtime#NYPennStation#LIRRMTA#savetheMayaLininPennStation#sculptor#architect#artist#oldnyc#contemporaryartist#contemporaryartistnyc#mta##mtaarts#mtaartsanddesign#art#walkingtoursnyc#nycwalkingtours#LaurieStoryNYC",

            "text": "Today, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres (@antonioguterres), the Secretary-General of the @UnitedNations will meet with global leaders for the 2019 #ClimateActionSummit in New York, bringing together governments, the private sector, civil society, local authorities and other international organizations to develop concrete, realistic plans towards a stronger and healthier world. At #PaceGallery, we're grateful for the artists across the globe whose practices seek to inspire engagement, build awareness, and drive momentum for #ClimateAction, such as #MayaLin. Lin's work \"Bay, Pond, & Harbor (Long Island Triptych),\" from 2014, pictured here, is currently on view at the Parrish Art Museum (@parrishart) on the East End of Long Island, and calls attention to the local bioregion in which the museum is situated, depicting three landmark bodies of water, Mecox Bay, Georgica Pond, and Accabonac Harbor, in recycled silver.\n-\nA passionate advocate for the environment, Lin's work reveals aspects of the natural world that are normally invisible to us\u2014the topography of the globe from ocean floor to mountain top, the evolving shape of coastlines and waterways\u2014highlighting the need to consider how human activities impact the planet as a whole. In her own words: \"On Long Island, you\u2019re surrounded by water on both sides; you\u2019ve got the bay coming up separating the North and the South Forks. I am extremely interested in the water\u2019s edge, and thinking about sea level and understanding how transmutable and temporal that boundary between land and sea actually is. I\u2019m very committed to doing something to help us understand and move quicker. I think this is going to be a huge part of our conversation in our lifetime. This is not something for the next two generations. It\u2019s happening now.\n-\nToday, in support of @ART2030org and the @UnitedNations\u00a0Climate Summit, we encourage you to share those artists who have inspired you to #ActNow in the fight against climate change.\n-\nImage: Maya Lin, \"Bay, Pond, & Harbor (Long Island Triptych),\" 2014, recycled silver, dimensions variable \u00a9\ufe0f Maya Lin",

Maya Lin referenced the historic use of the property in her design for \u201cThe Meeting Room\u201d at Queen Anne Square. This tour will discuss the design rationale and its connection to the site\u2019s history while considering the degree to which the square serves to memorialize the past.\n.\nAll conference attendees are invited to sign up for one of the series of tours on campus and throughout the city of Newport. Details are on the website \ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffbLink in Bio \ud83d\udc46\ud83c\udffb\n.\nFounded in 1968, the Newport Restoration Foundation (NRF) is dedicated to promoting and investing in the architectural heritage of the Newport community, the traditional building trades, and Doris Duke's fine and decorative arts collection, for the enjoyment, education and inspiration of all. NRF also supports research and education in areas that relate directly to its collections and to issue of critical concern to the field of historic preservation.\n.\n#preservationandmemory #salvechp #newportri #newportrestorationfoundation #preservationmatters #mayalin #queenannesquare #salvereginauniversity",

She is the artist who designed the Vietnam Memorial and is also who designed Ecliptic\u2014or what is known to Grand Rapidians as Rosa Parks Circle. Tonight at an event for @thestringproject1, I had the distinct pleasure of meeting Maya. After legit fangirling for a solid 3 or 4 minutes (like completely speechless fangirling!) and her not understanding why I was so excited to meet her, I realized that while she was indeed Maya Lin, she was not the ARTIST Maya Lin! \ud83e\udd23 After we all laughed for a good while and I got over my embarrassment, I quickly realized that I was equally as excited to meet this Maya Lin because she is truly a beautiful soul...and she really likes the artist who bears the same name as she as well! So, artist #mayalin next time you\u2019re in Grand Rapids, MI look me up because my new friend Maya and I really want to meet you!! Ya know, sometimes you\u2019ve just gotta laugh at yourself!\n_______________________\n\n#thestringproject \n#embarrassingmoments",

The series of thousands of pins follows the map of the French Broad River from end to end. The piece will be completed at a member's event at the museum on July 26. Staff at the Asheville Art Museum are hoping to announce a day for the reopening soon.

Today when I was walking around in Washington DC I really started to understand how much you had to give up. I started to realize you had to leave your job, family, possessions, and much, much more. You put your country in front of yourself and that means a lot to me. Thank you again for being a doctor in the Vietnam War. You saved many lives. I miss you..\u201d The rest of it is beneath the fold as it usually is. #memorialday #memorialdayweekend #vietnamwall #vietnamveteransmemorial #mayalin #johnbenson",

It was featured in an article @abug shared and we HAD to spend some time here. Also- it\u2019s right on a tram stop! (The park is 500 acres. This isn\u2019t just me being lazy!) This 11 ACRE earth work is a series of swelling hills in parallel succession. I feel like some earth art is inaccessible to the public- of course we often experience it through photos, which doesn\u2019t rally do the work justice. I feel like we all have an entry point to this installation- whether it\u2019s our own lawns and parks, the urge to climb and roll down a hill- or the love of a giant stretch of land that looks like it\u2019s just has a massive earthquake at about a ten on the richter scale. Had to stick on a couple pairs of legs because I\u2019ll always remember viewing it with Erica. @gilbertbell #stormking #artcenter #sculpturepark #newyork #earthart #mayalin #sketch #sketchbook #bordenandriley #andybellartist #installation #grass #lawn #bestlawnever #contemporaryart @stormkingartcenter",

Created in recycled silver, steel pins, and common building materials, Lin conceived of each sculpture through the use of charting, mapping, and scientific research to determine each work\u2019s ultimate design, layout, and structure.\n-\nLin, a committed environmentalist, has created two new sculptures for the exhibition that focus directly on West Michigan. Through scope, scale, and the seeming use of abstraction, Lin expands our awareness of the Great Lakes and their connection to other bodies of water and to the geological forces that created them.\n-\nImage: Maya Lin, \"Blue Lake Pass,\" 2006, duraflake particleboar installation, dimensions variable \u00a9\ufe0f Maya Lin Studio, Photo by G.R.

At the apex where the two walls meet, the dates 1959 and 1973 (marking the beginning and end of the #war) \"meet\" thus closing the circle of the time span of the war. A returning veteran can find his or her own time upon the wall, making each one's experience of the memorial very personal and individual. The siting of the piece is directly related to the presence of both the Lincoln Monument and Washington Memorial, tying it physically and historically to the site\n.\n.\nDue pareti di granito nero, poste sotto il livello del suolo, incise in ordine cronologico con i nomi degli uomini e delle donne che hanno dato la vita nella guerra del Vietnam. All'apice in cui si incontrano le due mura, le date 1959 e 1973 (che segnano l'inizio e la fine della guerra) \"si incontrano\" chiudendo cos\u00ec il cerchio del lasso di tempo della guerra.

            "text": "What art inspires you on campus? @Yale has played a part in fostering the careers of many artists and New Haven is home to an abundance of art. In this new series, we're asking students, faculty, and alumni to share the art on campus that has inspired them the most.\n.\nKavitha Bindra \u201905, Assistant Dean for Alumni Relations: \u201cMaya Lin was a huge influence on me when I was a student, and she continues to be one of the most innovative and ground-breaking artists out there. She is quietly transgressive and melds a warmth and humanity with the minimalism of her work. She has so much to say and conveys it all so simply and starkly. The Women's Table, which celebrates women at Yale, is one such piece.\u201d [Pictured: Maya Lin, Women\u2019s Table]\n.\nAbout Maya Lin's Women's Table at Yale: The Women\u2019s Table can be found in front of Sterling Memorial Library. Commissioned in 1989 by Yale\u2019s former president, Benno Schmidt, Lin (BA \u201881, M.Arch \u201886) created this work to commemorate the first female student at Yale, recognizing the addition (and absence) of women since the university\u2019s founding in 1701 which the artist conveys through the etchings of class years (up until 1993) on the table\u2019s surface. The sculptural installation exemplifies Lin\u2019s minimal design aesthetic, as well as her interest and her experience in art, architecture and public installations. Other notable examples of her past works include the Langston Hughes Library in Tennessee, the Museum of Chinese in America in New York and the Vietnam Memorial in Washington, DC for which she received the National Medal of the Arts in 2009.\n.\nPhotos: Zo\u00eb Goetzmann (@zoeseraart)\n.\n@mayalinstudio #mayalin #yalesom #yale #yaleart #newhaven #nhv #yalesomart",
